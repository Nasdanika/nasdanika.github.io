   issues:
     - name: Refactor the site to be generated using Engineering
       description: Implement support of actions, add existing actions to the model, e.g. exec. Descriptions for all products and modules.
     - name: Video recording article
       description: |+2
         "Knowledge base" section of the site.
         Structure - action model. (Tran)script - section. Use tabs section style.
         Record video. Record audio. Edit audio in Audacity - silence at front for noise profile, remove noise, edit, keep enough space between phrases, normalize, export.
         Git for the paranoid. Add audio to the project media. Align video and audio. Key shortcuts - zoom timeline, split, extend frame, ...
         Sample project on Git - commits for stages. Add captions. Add annotations. Add markers. Produce video. Publish - YouTube or own site - how to embed. 
         LinkedIn post. 
       effort: 40
     - name: Migrate to Java modules.
       description: Start from Engineering and go down to HTML and then Core.
     - name: Git history iteration
       description: In order to collect trends. One option is to check-out. Another - in-memory and use special URI's to address commits. E.g. commit://<commit id>/<path in the commit> - in order to load models. May be a special container of URI's to iterate.
     - name: Git resource and resource factory
       markdown-description: |+2
         To be able to reference resources in Git repositories. In-memory and local file system clone, maybe just the second one - easier, but would need to implement cleanup.
         Credentials from context or a method to override to lookup credentials by repo URL. Perhaps support aliases as URI authority and branch as the first segment with ability to 
         use interpolation. Configuration in Java and also by loading a YAML config file with aliases and encrypted/tokenized credentials. Consider using OS secure store as Maven does.  
     - name: Ecore for persistence principle
       markdown-description: |+2
         Add a principle - model data loaded from resources in Ecore. Reasons - documentation, support of multiple formats, multiple representations, e.g. HTML. Align exec refactoring to the principle as well as HTML models.
