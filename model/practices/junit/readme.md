TODO: Diagram (site - activities, artifacts, variation points), manually created sources, generated source, bytecode, coverage report. Lombok, ecore. 



Sorting (by dependency, size, ...), throttling, creation of work items

Comparison, positioning, complementary - availability of IDE plug-ins/extensions in org. Not better, different.

IDE plug-ins: select code, type a request, wait for generation, save to a file, add package declaration and some imports.

dependency:

* top-down - downstream dependencies might be tested along the way
* bottom-up

both have merits and might be applicable in diffent situations. bottom-up for new development, top-down for addressing technical debt.


TODO:

* All in one test
* Use of codex model
* Spring Pet Clinic as an example - as-is - no tests generated (tag), disable a test, generate.


## Parking lot

* Mention GitLab URI handler - get from, push to, create a merge reguest, link to sources
* Fine-tuned models (?) Llama 2?
* Massaging returned text - backticks, imports - explicit and implicit, use Java parser/model.
* Pet clinic demo - G/H fork, use GPT 4, specify SpringBoot and Mockito in prompt, tags - as is/disabled test methods
* Use with G/H copilot - complementary, different
* Unit tests delivery - branch, fork
