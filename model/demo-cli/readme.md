Nasdanika Demo (CLI) is an extension of the [Nasdanika CLI](../nsd-cli/index.html).
It demonstrates how to build CLI suites on top of other suites. 
It also contains commands demonstrating some Nasdanika capabilities, but not useful AS-IS. 
For example, YAML inspection command shows how to implement inspection of YAML, but it performs only basic validations.
