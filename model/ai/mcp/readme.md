This module will provide building blocks to create [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) servers on top of Nasdanika capabilities.

For example, [CLI](../../core/cli/index.html) commands exposing models and diagrams as resources. 
Imagine being able to chat with your diagrams such as a [C4 architecture diagram](https://nasdanika-demos.github.io/internet-banking-system-c4/cerulean/index.html) or a collection of diagrams/sites.
