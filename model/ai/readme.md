* Provides AI [capabilities](../core/capability/index.html) - embeddings and chat - from OpenAI and Ollama with unified interfaces.
* Separates concerns of AI functionality such as chat/embeddings, and [monitoring/telemetry/observability](../core/telemetry/index.html) of, say, token use.
* Provides building blocks for telemetry-enabled [Java MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/sdk/java/mcp-overview) clients and servers.
