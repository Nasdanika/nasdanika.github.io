Engineer extends Persona and as such can have goals. Because Persona extends Engineered Element it may have issues associated with it. When applied to an Engineers it may be development issues, e.g. training. Say, Joe Doe may have an issue &ldquo;Team lead training&rdquo; assigned to Jim Smith, his supervisor. What it means that Jim trains Joe and it is tracked in the same way as tracking of product development, i.e. you can develop (engineer) your organization in the same way you develop (engineer) products and services offered by your organization. Engineers may have capacity to work on endeavors and that capacity can be allocated to engineered elements and issue categories. In addition to owning engineered elements, engineers may have expertise in them. Ownership primarily means authority to make decisions about the owned elements. Expertise means knowledge of how to use them. Usually ownership assumes expertise, although the owner may consult the experts and then make decisions base on their inputs. Owners and experts form a community for an engineered element. Engineer may define increments, issue categories, and issue statuses. Typically it would be done at the top-level organization. Engineer may define personas and represent them. E.g. in an organization there might be a &ldquo;Developer&rdquo; persona defined at the &ldquo;Developer Experience&rdquo; organization and represented by developers. This allows to define personal goals by interviewing the representatives and then align organizaiton&rsquo;s endeavors to the persona goals. Engineers may also have objectives associated with endeavors, e.g. increments. E.g. &ldquo;Developer&rdquo; persona may have a goal &ldquo;Automate routine tasks&rdquo; and there might be an annual objective &ldquo;Create code generators&rdquo; aligned to that goal. Then, subsequently, a feature &ldquo;Cloud microservice code generator&rdquo; can be aligned to the &ldquo;Create code generators&rdquo; objective or it&rsquo;s key result, say &ldquo;5 code generators for the cloud&rdquo;. Engineers may contain modules. E.g. a team may contain libraries developed by the team and then ownership of these libraries may be assigned to team members. Engineers may also provide services - shared activities used by other engineers or personas. For example, a performance testing team may provide a testing service used by development teams to performance test modules they own. Services may be defined as journeys leveraging services provided by other engineers. For example, the performance team&rsquo;s service &ldquo;Performance test an application&rdquo; may use a service &ldquo;Provision cloud environment&rdquo; provided by the cloud infrastructure team. And, finally, engineers may post messages to topics of discussion forums.

Features Generated diagrams with tooltips and links from the shapes to model elements pages: Package diagrams - shows package elements and their relationships. Class context diagrams - shows a class, related elements and relationships. Configurable relationship depth, 1 by default. Class inheritance diagrams - shows a class and all of its supertypes. Rich documentation using Markdown with support of embedded images and diagrams. Javadoc integration. Load specification for models which are loaded with Nasdanika EMF Persistence. Model documentation cross-referencing. Site-scoped integrated search, including searching in diagrams1. Detection of broken links, including broken links in diagrams. Traceability from documentation to model sources stored in a version control system, e.g. Git, can be added if needed - remote location and commit. Examples Ncore Diagram Flow Exec HTML Bootstrap Application Engineering Documenting models Models are documented in Markdown using model annotations. There are the following ways to document the model: http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/GenModel (GenModel) annotation, documentation details. With this method you have to set &ldquo;Suppress GenModel Annotations&rdquo; to false in the GenModel editor (true by default). urn:org.nasdanika annotation: documentation-reference - location of a resource (file, URL) containing markdown documentation for an element. The location is resolved relative to the model (.ecore file) location. load-doc - Load documentation if different from the general documentation. load-doc-reference - location of a resource (file, URL) containing markdown load documentation for an element. The location is resolved relative to the model (.ecore file) location. Resource references in Markdown fenced blocks (images and diagrams) are resolved relative to the .ecore file location for documentation embedded into the model (GenModel and documentation-reference) and relative to documentation resources for referenced documentation. This is achieved by adding It works AS-IS when all generation steps are performed on the same machine. If you decide to separate generation steps, e.g. generate action models and publish them to a binary repository and generate Web sites from them later, then you will need to package image and diagram resources together with the action model and modify the markers. One simple way to do it is to package the action model together with the .ecore model - in this case you&rsquo;ll just need to relativize marker locations. Referencing EClassifiers You can reference EClassifiers available in the model resource set using ${classifier/&lt;classifier name&gt;[@&lt;package namespace URI&gt;]} token. Examples: ${classifier/Activity} - Activity classifier in the same EPackage. Classifiers in the same EPackage can also be addressed by adding .html to the classifier name, e.g. [Activity](Activity.html). ${classifier/Activity@urn:org.nasdanika.flow} - Activity classifier in EPackage with urn:org.nasdanika.flow namespace URI. During generation you will need to pass EPackage path computer to org.nasdanika.html.ecore.EcoreActionSupplierAdapterFactory constructor. See TestNasdanikaDocEngineeringGen.generateEcoreActionModel() for an example. Javadoc To link EClassifier instance class names to their javadocs you&rsquo;ll need to pass a Javadoc resolver to EcoreActionSupplierAdapterFactory constructor. See TestNasdanikaDocEngineeringGen.generateEcoreActionModel() above for an example. To create links to Javadoc in makrdown you may use &lt;fully replacement tokens. For example, org.nasdanika.common.Context would be replaced with org.nasdanika.common.Context. You will need to add a Javadoc resolver to the generation context as exemplified here. Generation steps To use add ecore dependency to pom.xml, e.g. &lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;org.nasdanika.html&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;ecore&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;2022.4.0&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n Then write generation logic following the below examples: TestNasdanikaDocEngineeringGen.java - generator of this web site. TestEcoreDoc.java - a test generating documentation for a few models. Generate action model If you are generating documentation for cross-referencing models, you may need to copy the models so their physical relative location on disk matches their relative logical location in Eclipse (project name). For example, Ncore physical location relative to the Git root directory is core/ncore, but its logical (project) name in Eclipse is org.nasdanika.ncore. Therefore, in order for the flow model to reference Ncore classes the Ncore model is copied from core/ncore to org.nasdanika.ncore in a Maven target directory. The flow model is copied in a similar way. Generate resource model Once you have generated action models, mount them to a root action model (defined in actions.yml in the examples above) and generate a resource model using a page template - defined in page-template.yml in the examples.

In a situation of limited resources, which is the case most of the time, that efforts need to be carefully organized to achieve the maximum bang for the buck. The goal of Nasdanika Engineering is to help to carefully organize efforts in order to bring something about. That &ldquo;about&rdquo; may be a software product, an organization, a vacation, or life in general. Nasdanika Engineering provides science and tooling to guide and track the process of translating dreams and ideas into organizing thought, sharing that organized thought with others and aligning efforts of many to turn dreams and ideas into reality. Nasdanika Engineering takes a low-tech approach - all you need to use it is a text editor to author YAML and Markdown files. Shall YAML and Markdown sound scary for non-technical people, YAML is a glorified indented list - if you know how to create a PowerPoint slide with bullet points, you should be able to manage YAML. And Markdown is pretty close to plain text. YAML and Markdown are resource formats supported out-of-the box. If needed, model data can be loaded from other resources. E.g. issues can be loaded from issue trackers such as GitHub Issues, Jira, or MantisBT by implementing resource factories for respective systems. Then you&rsquo;d need Java 8+ and Maven to generate a static HTML site from those files. Optionally, you can publish your site - there are many options, e.g. GitHub Pages. You wouldn&rsquo;t need a database or a cloud application - you can keep your plans on an encrypted flash drive in a safe in an underground vault, shall they be super-secret. Because with Nasdanika Engineering all artifacts &ldquo;live&rdquo; in one place it makes it an attractive choice for small efforts, or efforts which may have long periods of dormancy - POC&rsquo;s, R&amp;D, ideation, innovation, and conceptualization. In the case of innovation in an organization, innovators may benefit from shared models, e.g. an organization model with products, services, personas, and goals - in this case an innovation idea can be defined in terms/context of these products, services, and goals. E.g. &ldquo;Build a new service X which would leverage an existing service A and product B to address goal C of the internal persona D&rdquo;. This disciplined innovation would help the innovators to align their innovations to organization goals, and the rest of organization to grasp the value of the ideas and prioritize them for implementation. In a team environment Nasdanika Engineering files can be kept in a source control system such as Git. For example, on GitHub. In this case site generation and publishing can be done on code push, e.g. with CircleCI or Jenkins. In case of using Nasdanika Engineering to engineer a software product, engineering files with the source code. In a multi-module, multi-product scenario engineering files for each product/module can be kept with the source code of that product/module and then be federated into one model to generate a team/organization site. Nasdanika documentation site is generated this way. Nasdanika Engineering has 46 classes - see below and in the navigation panel on the left, which can be roughly grouped into the following categories: Structure - a skeleton to support the work done by the muscles. Behavior - muscles which do the work. Strategy - brain which directs the work towards goal achievement. General purpose - connective tissue assisting the above categories. It is not necessary to know and use all the classes at once - pick what you need to get started and then expand as needed. The below sections provide overview of the core concepts, each of the categories, and explain how to get started with Nasdanika Engineering. For step-by-step instructions see the User Guide. Core concepts Getting started The easiest way to get started is to download or clone the Engineering Demo repository. You may download the latest version or any of releases. If you clone, you may checkout any of tags as a starting point. Defining the model With Nasdanika Engineering you create an engineering model by defining instances of model classes in YAML or other format, e.g. JSON. YAML is a preferred format because it is more user friendly and also because Nasdanika Engineerings keeps track of line numbers in YAML files, but this functionality is not currently supported for JSON. As has been mentioned above, a model can be loaded from different types of resources, e.g. some parts of the model can be loaded from YAML while other parts would be loaded from, say, Jira. When creating YAML specifications use &ldquo;Load specification&rdquo; section of respective classes to find supported configuration keys. Below is a partial sample definition of an organization: engineering-organization:\n   name: Nasdanika Engineering Demo\n   path: demo \n   table-of-contents: \n     role: content-left\n     header: Contents\n You can find a full definition here. Note that the organization definition starts with engineering-organization where engineering is a package name and organization is class name. For references which are not homogenous it is required to provide class names. Homogenous references have elements of the same type and therefore there is no need to provide class names. table-of-contents above is an example of a homogenous reference. A YAML file can reference another YAML file by using a string as reference value, unless that reference is a strict-containment. In the latter case the value is treated as a value of the default feature, as in the case of Transition:   elements:\n    - engineering-activity:\n        name: A\n        path: a\n        outputs:\n          - b\n outputs is a journey element homogenous reference with strict containment and target is Transition&rsquo;s default feature. Therefore, b is treated as a value of target. Default features are shown in bold in load specifications. The below code snippet demonstrates referencing specification defined in other files/URL&rsquo;s:    resources:\n     - resources/user-guide/root.yml\n     - resources/base-journey/root.yml\n     - resources/extended-journey/root.yml\n resources reference is not strict-containment and therefore its value is treated as a URL, which is resolved relatively to the YAML resource URL. Please note that when referencing external resources homogenous is ignored, i.e. the resource must contain the type declaration. Generating a site You may generate a site by using Maven - mvn package or mvn clean package. If you work on a model in a Java IDE such as Eclipse you may run TestModel.testGenerateDemoSite() from the IDE. The generation process creates a lot of console output, you may redirect it to a file if desired. The generation process diagnoses the model and outputs warnings and errors, if there are any, at the end of console output. Warnings and errors are also displayed on the generated site. Diagnostic output to the console is very detailed and may be hard to read. It is easier to use the generated site to inspect the diagnostic, unless there was FAIL level diagnostic which caused generation to fail. Generation may also fail due to incorrect configuration - wrong configuration key or resource URL. Inspect error messages for details. Below is a sample error message - it tells what is wrong (Unsupported configuration key) and the location of the offending specification (demo.yml line 3 column 4): Tests in error:\n  testGenerateDemoSite(org.nasdanika.engineering.demo.TestModel): Unsupported configuration key: path_ at file:/.../engineering-demo/target/test-classes/demo.yml 3:4\n Structure This section provides an overview of models classes which can be categorized as structural - instances of these classes define a skeleton to which other instances are &ldquo;attached&rdquo;. First of all, ModelElement and NamedElement are base classes from which most of the other classes inherit. Although is some cases not necessary, it is recommended to specify path attribute for model elements in order to have semantic URI&rsquo;s and URL&rsquo;s. A number of classes inherit from Period which supports floating, absolute, or relative start and end dates - temporals, and duration. It allows to express plans in relative temporal terms, e.g. &ldquo;Hire a tester 60 day after the project kick-off&rdquo; where &ldquo;Project kick-off&rdquo; is an event which can be initially &ldquo;unbound&rdquo;, i.e. specified without absolute or relative date. Later on an event can be &ldquo;bound&rdquo; to an &ldquo;instant&rdquo; - absolute time, or to another temporal - an event or start/end of a period, e.g. 30 days before quarter end. Temporals may have lower and upper bounds. For example, an exact date for some event may be unknown, but it might be know that it would happen no later or no sooner than a certain point of time - absolute or relative - or within a certain time range. Engineer or Organization are typically roots of the model. For a single-person efforts with no delegation whatsoever you may define a model with an engineer as its root. However, in many cases even for efforts which start as one-man shop eventually comes time when some tasks need to be delegated and execution tracked. This is when you&rsquo;d need an organization as it is an engineer which can contain other engineers. Engineers may contain modules and products and own engineered elements. Note that an Engineer is a sub-class of EngineeredElement, i.e. an Engineer can be engineered. For example, a person can be mentored or take courses and an organization can improve its processes. Behavior Behavior classes are used to represent things to be done on the structure or external entities to achieve goals. They are subdivided into two sub-categories: What - specifies what needs to be done, e.g. &ldquo;Create a Customer Profile microservice&rdquo;. It may specify how it needs to be done or may reference the existing How, e.g. &ldquo;Create a new microservice&rdquo; journey. How - specifies how a particular task shall be carried out. What There are two base classes for the classes in this category: Endeavor EngineeredCapability, which extends Endeavor. In your models you would use subclasses of the above two classes: Issue and its subclass Decision. With issue you would use: Note to track progress IssueCategory IssuePriority IssueSeverity IssueStatus Feature Release Increment How The How means what is traditionally User Guides and Cookbooks - step-by-step instructions. With Nasdanika Engineering you can create such step-by-step guides as documents with multiple sections. However, there is another way and you may choose what is most appropriate in a given situation and even combine the two. Humans are image processors, not text processors. So if your instructions are not single level linear, i.e. there are steps and sub-steps and also conditional logic, chances are that if presented visually these instructions would be easier to follow. Nasdanika Engineering has a number of classes which can be used to create visual representations of (work)flows. Because they can be used to capture scenarios of how personas use products and services provided by an engineer or an organization, they are called journeys. A journey is a directed graph of journey elements - activities, nested journeys, services, and pseudo-states. Journey elements can transition control from one another and also call one another. Because journey elements inherit from ModelElement, they can have documentation sections to benefit from a combination of non-linear and linear knowledge representation. One important feature of journeys is journey inheritance, which is similar to inheritance in languages like Java - it is possible to define a base journey and then extend it and customize (override) journey elements. Journey inheritance can be useful in hierarchies such as organization hierarchies and technology hierarchies. In an organization hierarchy higher levels can define generic processes and specify which elements can be customized at lower levels and which cannot. Lower levels of the organization would customize what they need to their specifics, e.g. local regulations. Similar to that, in the world of technology one can define, say, a generic journey explaining how to develop and deploy a microservice. Then that journey can be customized to different ways to deploy, e.g. different cloud providers - private and public, and their offerings. Document and section inheritance is not currently supported, it will be added in the future releases. Strategy Anything worthwhile takes time and effort to build, &hellip; and there are so many ways to skin a cat. If you are working on that worthwhile alone you will need a way to ensure that you are staying focused on achieving your goals. If you are working with others, you&rsquo;ll need a way to provide to your team means for efficient decision making to avoid prolonged debates. With Nasdanika Engineering you do it with subclasses of Aim to which alignables such as endeavors and other aims can be aligned to. For example, issues can be aligned to, say, persona goals to ensure that your org is doing the right thing, and to principles to ensure that you are doing it right. An issue &ldquo;Build Customer Profile microservice&rdquo; can be aligned to a customer persona goal &ldquo;Manage my information&rdquo; and The Twelve Factor App principles. Nasdanika Engineering also supports the OKR goal setting framework via Objective and KeyResult classes. It is possible to define issues as initiatives under key results. This provides an alternative way to organize efforts - instead of defining issues under products and modules and then aligning them to aims. You may pick a method which works best for your situation or use a combination of these two approaches. In the case of defining issues as initiatives you may have something like this: Organization Mission - top level goal. Organization goals - multiple. Increments - quarters, years. Organization objectives aligned to goals Key results Engineers and sub-organizations Objectives for increments linked to organization key results Key results Initiatives with sub-issues hierarchy. General purpose Appearance and its subclasses can be used to declaratively customize the generated UI. Customization can be done at the class level, i.e. customizations would apply to all, say, issues, or at an individual model element level. Directory is a way to group resources such as documents, links, named element references, and any named elements in general. Model elements and documents which use sections can use tables of contents. Engineered elements can have discussion topics with messages and nested forums. For example, there might be a discussion forum for a document section or for a journey activity. This allows to have highly focused micro-communities of practice where engineered element owners and experts help others. For software development efforts models &ldquo;live&rdquo; with the code and follow its lifecycle - branching, commits, merges. As some of engineering model elements are executable, e.g. already mentioned Vinci actions, the models are code by definition as they contain instructions to be executed by a computer. Unlike text files or spreadsheets which can also &ldquo;live&rdquo; with the code, models provide more structure and functionality for the engineering domain. &ldquo;As-code&rdquo; approach may be attractive in the following situations: Sensitive data - with as-code approach such data may be kept in a highly secure fashion and never cross the network. Reduced infrastructure requirements - there is no need for an issue tracking server.

Flow extends activity and as such flows can be nested. Artifacts can also be nested, which allows to model composite artifacts such as modular and distributed systems, e.g. a cloud application. Flow models can be defined in a set of cross-referencing YAML files with supporting Markdown documentation either embedded in YAML or stored in files. Markdown documentation supports embedding of diagrams and token interpolation/substitution. Textual definitions of flows in multiple files allow to work with them in the same way as with source code, say, Java - branch, create a pull request, merge. In a way, Nasdanika Flow allows to write &ldquo;programs&rdquo; to be executed by an organization similar to how Java programs are executed by a JVM or how distributed systems, such as cloud applications, operate. Textual format also means that flow definitions can be edited and viewed using a wide variety of tools, including viewing and editing in a web browser using native facilities of source control systems such as GitHub. A static web site is generated from flow models. Generated site includes generated visualizations - PlantUML State diagrams or Diagrams.net diagrams. Diagrams.net diagrams can be manually edited after generation. Dynamic behavior can be added to generated pages using Single Page Applications, e.g. applications built with Vue.js, VueRouter, and BootstrapVue. It allows to inject fine-grained productivity tools into activities where they are used. Such tools may use more generic tools behind the scenes and &ldquo;bind&rdquo; some contextual parameters to reduce participant&rsquo;s mental load and probability of mistakes. Flows can extend other flows forming an inheritance hierarchy similar to inheritance in languages such as Java or Docker images specifying base images. This allows to define base process/flow packages and extend/tailor them to specific needs. Nasdanika Flow also features: Responsibility Assignment Matrices, Validation, Data Provenance. Core concepts Package - Root element of the flow model containing other elements including sub-packages. Flow - A composite activity containing flow elements - activities, flows, services, and pseudo-states. Activity - a flow element performed by a participant. Has output transitions and may call other flow elements. Activities can specify input and output artifacts, responsibility assignments, and artifact responsibility assignments. Transition - when an activity completes it passes control and artifacts to subsequent activities via transitions. Fire-and-forget. Transitions may specify payload - artifacts which they carry from source to target. Call - a flow element may call other flow elements as part of its execution. Calling activity blocks waiting for the called activity to complete. Request-reply. In addition to payload calls may specify response - artifacts returned to the source from the target, e.g. a signed certificate or connectivity parameters for a new database. Participant - performs activities. May contain (offer) shared activities (including flows) as services which can be referenced from flows. E.g., a technology team may offer a service &ldquo;Create a cloud Environment&rdquo; referenced from multiple flows. A service offered by one participant may call services offered by other participants. Resource - something used to complete activities. E.g. IDE or Cl/CD pipeline. Resources can be repositories of artifacts and can provide shared activities - services, which can be referenced from flows. Artifact - inputs and outputs of activities passed between activities via transitions and calls and stored in repository resources. E.g., a design document or source code. Artifacts can form a containment hierarchy and can reference template artifacts. Service - a flow element referencing an activity provided by a participant or resource. Pseudo-states - used to combine and direct transitions. Knowledge continuum One way to think about a flow model is as of a &ldquo;knowledge continuum&rdquo; where knowledge of how to do things is organized in progression from generic to specific with bi-directional links between more generic and more specific pieces. Activity documentation would be the most specific unit of knowledge, or, to be more precise, a mix of bits and pieces of knowledge from multiple domains/disciplines. For example, to perform a microservice development activity a developer need to know how to use IDE, source control system, an issue tracking system, etc. However, they don&rsquo;t need to know all of that at the expert level. E.g. they just need to know how to commit their code to the source control system and how to update an issue. They don&rsquo;t necessarily need to know how to do branching, merging, rebasing. Activity documentation may contain links to specific parts of reference manuals for resources and artifacts used by the activity, e.g. a specific chapter in a source control reference manual. Bi-directional references between activities and participants, resources, and artifacts used in activity are automatically generated. Resource, Artifact, and Participant documentation is more generic, but still specific to the flow package. E.g. documentation for a build tool resource may provide a description how the tool is used in the flow and contain references to external resources - manuals, book, video courses. Bi-directional links between participants and tools/artifacts they use in all activities are automatically generated. A person who is new to playing a role of a particular participant may study participant documentation including resources the participant uses and activities it participates in. And finally, resources referenced from the flow documentation are most generic and flow-independent. These resources can also be categorized, if needed, from specific to generic. E.g. there might be documentation on how to use a particular tool within the organization and documentation on how to use the tool in general. Examples TOGAF ADM Sources Generated documentation Tests Sources - JUnit tests to generate HTML from models. Resources - flow definitions. Generated documentation Core Agile - not a real Agile flow, just a demo. AWS - extends (inherits from) the Core Agile above, adds AWS-specific artifacts. Flow - inherited from the Core Agile. Components - hierarchical AWS-specific artifacts. Process overview An example of generating a web site from a flow model can be found here - TestTogafAdmGen.java. Generation steps: Load the model from YAML or other resource. Optionally validate. Abstract and mix-in models may contain validation errors such as unresolved proxies &ldquo;by design&rdquo; and therefore shall not be validated upon load. Create an instance model. At this step you may save the instance model to XMI to logically separate processing steps. You may also enrich the model by loading data from external systems. Generate an action model from the instance model. Generate a resource model from the action model. At this step you may combine multiple action models. Generate a site (container) from the resource model. Maven dependency To use the flow model add the following dependency to pom.xml: &lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;org.nasdanika.core&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;flow&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;2022.1.2&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n A list of versions can be found here."},"modules/engineering/modules/model/Issue.html":{"path":"Products/Engineering/Model/Issue","action-uuid":"dbe9ff4c-c36c-416e-8d2c-39317a04f5c0","title":"Issue","content":"org.nasdanika.engineering.Issue Issue is a unit of work to accomplish to achieve a desired outcome on its containing engineered element, e.g.: New functionality in a module, New or refined persona goals, New skills acquired by an engineer, Improved organization processes.

Create DurationProbability class extending Duration in Flow, or just Duration with weight. Weight default value is 1. For flows without explicitly provided durations compute durations from elements. For a low number of permutations use all permutations, for a high use something like Monte Carlo method. In both cases computed results can be grouped into &quot;slices&quot; with different weights. Number of computed durations is an attribute with default value, say 10 or 20. Slicing may use the same weight for slices with a large number of samples and make the number of samples equal in each slice. For the tails of distribution and outliers it would use lower weights. The number of simulations to run shall be configurable via flow attribute(s). Options - total number, absolute, relative number - computed from the number of elements, time bound - no more than, say, 10 seconds, combination of thereof, e.g. no more than 10 seconds, but at least 1000 iterations even if it takes more than 10 seconds. Create a feature explaining how it works and how to use it. getDuration(double) method returning duration for a number between 0 and 1 - sum all weights, find an entry which the argument &quot;falls in&quot; and return it - running weight (sum) previous is lower, next is higher or there is no next (1). For a single element simply return its duration. Transition type - end-to-start (default), the other 3. Not applicable to calls - may have a diagnostic or throw an error if used on calls. Consider adding support of Duration Observation - value, when, maybe description. Derive distribution from observations if no durations were specified. Consider using some weight scale based on how far in the past, i.e. recent observations have more weight. Maybe a generic observation in Flow or Ncore model which may have individual named metrics - duration, sentiment (rating). Metrics may have individual comments. Observations may be captured in some system using, say, URI as a correlation id, and then be &quot;injected&quot; into the model during load. Then clear feature cache.

Flow inheritance can be useful in hierarchies such as organizational hierarchies and technology hierarchies. In an organizational hierarchy higher levels can define generic processes and specify which elements can be customized at lower levels and which cannot - final elements. Lower levels of the organization would customize what they need to their specifics, e.g. local regulations. Similar to that, in the world of technology one can define, say, a generic flow explaining how to develop and deploy a SpringBoot microservice. Then that flow can be customized to different ways to deploy, e.g. different cloud providers - private and public, and their offerings. For example, a package containing flows for agile software development using a particular technology, say SpringBoot on AWS, may extends a package containing generic agile flows as well as a package containing AWS-specific flows and other element which are agnostic to a particular development methodology. Extension packages may: * Add elements. * Override elements - replace definitions. * Suppress (remove) elements. This is similar to inheritance in object-oriented languages like lava where subclasses can add and override inherited methods. Method suppression is not available in lava. Similar to Java, elements can be defined as final and abstract - final elements cannot be overridden, and abstract elements must be overridden. For example, there might be an abstract flow for developing a cloud application with concrete elements which are common for different cloud providers and abstract elements which are provider or technology specific. Flow inheritance is also similar to basing Docker images on other images using FRROM, but with support of &ldquo;mix-in&rdquo; images with multiple inheritance. Inheritance allows multiple teams to incrementally build a &ldquo;whole end-to-end picture&rdquo; for flow participants.

An Objective sets the direction &mdash; like a destination on a map - where the engineer or an organization want to go. For example, a quarterly objective or an objective for release 1.0. Objectives can be contained by engineers and reference endeavors, or they may be contained by endeavors and in this case the endeavor assignee is the &ldquo;owner&rdquo; of the objective. Objectives can contain sub-objectives or they can point to a parent objective contained elsewhere. Objectives may contain key results, which are a way to measure progress towards the objective. Both objectives and key results extend aim and as such endeavors and other aims can be aligned to them. Example Joe Doe works for Acme Corp. Acme Corps defines an annual objective aligned to the corporate goals. Then it defines quarterly objectives aligned to the annual objective and key results for quarterly objectives. When the corporate objectives are published, Joe Doe creates his quarterly objectives and links them with a parent link to several key results of the corporate quarterly objectives. Then he defines key results under his objectives and aligns his endeavors to the key results.

See the generators module for available generators and code examples. The goal of the diagram model is to provide &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; visualizations with the focus or the ease of creation and maintenance (re-generation). A picture is worth of a thousand words. Humans are visual creatures - visuals improve learning up to 400%. However, if a visual is too &ldquo;costly&rdquo; to create or maintain it might be not worth it to create it in the first place. Below is a quick overview of the model elements: Diagram - the root of a diagram model which contains DiagramElements and Notes. DiagramElement - a shape/node/vertex on a diagram. Contains Connections and other diagram elements. Extends Style and Link. Has two specializations - Start and End used for generating state diagrams. Connection - contained by a source diagram element and references a target diagram element. Extends Style. Note - Diagram, DiagramElement, or Connection note. Style - styling for DiagramElements and Connections. Defines generic styling attributes and allows to define generation target specific styling via properties. Link - a link to a URL with text and tooltip. Base class for DiagramElement. Can also be used in DiagramElement name, description, and Note content. See the package diagram for visual representation and documentation of model elements for detailed descriptions of model classes and their features.

Abstract elements must be overridden or suppressed in concrete flows. Flows can also specify final elements which cannot be overridden.

The primary target audience of the Nasdanika product line are Java developers who use Maven. The main theme can be expressed as &ldquo;Efficient knowledge capture and dissemination&rdquo; using Domain-Driven Design, Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and code generation being the means to efficiently codify knowledge and then disseminate it. Well, it&rsquo;s a mouthful! Let&rsquo;s elaborate a bit! First of all, &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; above means minimal requirements of human and computing resources per &ldquo;unit of knowledge&rdquo;. It also means hyper-local and hyper-focused experiences because humans are notoriously bad at context switching. One of approaches to minimize context switching is use of code generation using Java, e.g. generation of Bootstrap Web applications using fluent Java API. Another one is an option to author models in YAML without having to use a specialized model editor. Computing resources-wise - no need in server components, you can use Nasdanika products on a flash drive in a bunker or in the wilderness with no network: --everything-is-hyper-local, paraphrasing the Git motto. Access to the Internet would be needed only to pull the required libraries from Maven Central or a mirror. Sample scenario Models Engineering Flow Domain Meta-Model creation Meta-Model documentation Production of Meta-Model binaries Model editing Consumption of Meta-Model binaries Consumption of model content Use of the models Populate the model YAML or JSON Tree editor Diagram editor Specialized text editor Custom resources and factories Web application Programmatic Products overview Sample scenario You&rsquo;ve got an idea of a new &ldquo;something&rdquo; - not necessarily software. Depending on the problem at hand, how your brain is wired, and who you need to communicate your idea to, you may start with  domain model, flow model, or the engineering model. Models Engineering With the engineering model you can define consumers of what you want to create - personas - and their goals. This will allow you to better understand and communicate the Why of your idea. It will also allow you enlist help of others, e.g. potential users, to elaborate the personas and their goals - they likely know better than you what they want, unless you are building it for yourself. Then1 you may define products and their features. You may break down products into modules. Align features to goals. This would define the What of your idea tied to the Why. Then, define releases, issues, increments, engineers. Assign features to releases, issues to features or releases, and releases to increments. Assign issues to engineers. You may also assign responsible engineers to releases, features, and increments. This would define the How and the When both traceable to the What (features) and the Why (persona goals). As it was mentioned above, all of that can be done on a local computer - you don&rsquo;t need any server component, you don&rsquo;t even need to keep it under version control, although it is a good idea. So, if you have a super-secret idea you can keep everything on an encrypted thumb drive and work on it at night in your basement. In a team environment you can use an isolated network to collaborate. One more advantage of everything is local is that you may produce self-contained idea definitions which can be archived, copied/forked etc. It allows to establish a discovery-delivery pipeline where many ideas can be brought to high enough level of detail to allow efficient selection for delivery later. Having shared definitions of personas, goals, principles, and objectives would simplify comparison of ideas based on their benefit and cost. There is more to it, see the engineering model documentation and a list of features for more details. Flow With Nasdanika Flow you can create and publish models of flows - graphs of activities performed by participants using resources and consuming and producing artifacts. With Nasdanika Flow you can model customer journeys and team processes. Services allow to build flows &ldquo;in terms&rdquo; of other flows, e.g. a customer journey flow referencing an internal process as an activity. Inheritance allows to define common flows and then customize them. For example, in an IT organization there might be core development process and then technology and regions specific extensions. The flow concepts are very similar to the concepts of a programming language, such as Java, or of a distributed system, such as a cloud application. In other words with Nasdanika Flow you can &ldquo;program&rdquo; or &ldquo;codify&rdquo; operations of an organization. The journey package in the engineering model (work in progress) aims to provide a bridge between the flow model and then engineering model in order to allow to define flows at persona level, reference personas from participant definitions, products/features from resource definitions, etc. With that it would be possible to build persona (customer) journeys in terms of product features and services provided by the organization and its engineers. Domain Problem domain structure is captured in a form of EMF Ecore (meta) model using Ecore Tools, which are part of Eclipse Modeling Tools Package. You can use a diagram or a tree editor to create domain models. Flow and Engineering models mentioned above are examples of domain models for different problem domains. Domain models serve the following purposes: Form a Ubiquitous Language - a common rigorous language between users and developers. Nasdanika HTML Ecore allows to generate documentation from Ecore models, &ldquo;publish a dictionary&rdquo; so to speak. It automatically generates pacakge diagrams, class context and inheritance diagrams. Documentation can be defined in annotations or loaded from external resources. Model documentation is written in Markdown and can contain embedded diagrams. Generate Java code to load, diagnose, manipulate and save models. EMF Ecore provides capabilities to load models from and save to XML (XMI). Nasdanika EMF adds an ability to load models from an arbitrary storage of maps, lists, and scalars - YAML, JSON, properties files. When loading from YAML the loaded injects markers into the loaded objects to trace data elements to resource (file), line, column where they were loaded from. If a Git repository is detected then a GitMarker is injected instead with information about remotes and the commit hash. In a a model loaded from multiple resources residing in multiple Git repositories it allows to trace data elements to their source in &ldquo;space&rdquo; (repository, file, line and column) and time (commit). You&rsquo;ve probably heard before that &ldquo;all models are wrong, but some are useful&rdquo;. Models are wrong by definition because their purpose to reflect an aspect of interest of reality. If we define usefulness as positive ROI and short time to market, then with Nasdanika approach to modeling it is easier to create a useful model because production and publication of a model requires less effort than alternative approaches as explained below. Meta-Model creation Use Ecore Tools. Meta-Model documentation Nasdanika: Generate HTML with visualizations from models, mount it to a larger site. This site is an example of this approach. Alternatives: Manual or Javadoc from generated model classes. Production of Meta-Model binaries Nasdanika: Maven Java build publishing to a Maven repository. Alternatives: Maven Tycho build generating a p2 site which needs to be hosted somewhere. Model editing Nasdanika: Any text editor to author YAML or JSON - use load specification from the generation documentation to create model instances. Alternatives: An editor shall be created and published to a p2 site and used from Eclipse. Or a web server is needed to host an in-browser editor. Consumption of Meta-Model binaries To programmatically read or write models. Nasdanika: Any Maven application - add a dependency. Alternatives: Eclipse product, OSGi bundle dependency. Consumption of model content Nasdanika: Generate an HTML site from the model. Alternatives: Requires Eclipse IDE and an editor/viewer or a server to host a web viewer One area where Nasdanika approach to modeling may be useful is disposable/situational models - use a modeling approach to solve a problem which is small enough to justify investment into graphical editors, p2 hosting etc., but large enough to benefit from automation. Metaphorically speaking, Nasdanika uses r-selection - create cheap models quickly, see which one is useful and then invest more if needed. The alternatives tend to be closer to the K end of the spectrum requiring larger up-front investment. Use of the models Populate the model Once there is a domain Ecore (meta) model you can start creating model resources containing definitions of model elements. E.g. if your meta-model contains classes Organization and Engineer, you may define organization, &ldquo;Acme Corp.&rdquo; with an engineer &ldquo;Joe Doe&rdquo;. There are multiple ways to populate the model. Some of them are listed below. You don&rsquo;t to use one particular way - they can be used in combination. Some resources in your model may be defined YAML and edited in a text editor, some other may be defined in XMI and edited with, say, a diagram editor. There resources can cross-reference each other. YAML or JSON You can create models in YAML, see EMF Persistence. With this approach, unlike the others listed below, you don&rsquo;t need to create a specialized editor - just use a YAML or text editor and load specification pages of the generated model documentation as a reference. Because models are defined in text, as-code, they are easy to collaborate on without the use of specialized merge tools - use traditional diff and merge as for other textual artifacts such as Java files. This approach also allows to relatively easily load data from external systems which have no knowledge of your models&rsquo; XMI format. Data can be loaded from REST endpoints or from data exports. Tree editor You can generate a tree editor for your models using Ecore Tools. It is a relatively small effort, but you&rsquo;ll need to build it, publish to a p2 repository (update site) and model authors will need to have Eclipse IDE and to be able to install the editor. Diagram editor With Eclipse Sirius you can generate visual diagram editors and with Sirius Web you can provide a web interface for editing models. Specialized text editor With Xtext you can create a specialized text editor with syntax highlighting, code completions, live validation and other features. Custom resources and factories You can also load data from external sources by implementing a custom Resource and Resource.Factory. YamlResource and YamlResourceFactory are examples of such implementation. For example, you may create a resource to load issue information from Jira using Jira Java API. In Domain-Driven Design terminology such resource and a resource factory would act as an Anti-Corruption Layer. Web application So you&rsquo;ve captured quite a bit of knowledge in your models, now it is time to share it! One way to share knowledge with humans is to generate a web site. For example, this site was generated from multiple engineering models stored in multiple Git repositories with documentation generated from Ecore models &ldquo;mounted&rdquo; to it. You can add dynamic read-only behavior to the generated site using Single-page applications which use model data. All issues page is an example of such an application built with Vue.js and BootstrapVue. It uses browser local storage for user preferences. This approach allows to have highly focused mini-apps injected into a static web site. Shall you need more dynamic behavior you can use helper web services. In this case model data can be used as input to the services in addition to user-provided data putting user input into a context. E.g. a single site may have multiple mini-apps calling the same service but with different inputs. Programmatic Model data can also be used by computers. In Java you use the generated model classes. You may load your model from multiple sources and then save it to XMI which can be published to a binary repository or on a web site. In non-java scenarios you may generate code in the target language. E.g. cross-referencing JSON files for a static REST API or JavaScript files to use model information in the browser. It can be done in combination with generating a static file, i.e. your site would contain both HTML and JSON/JavaScript. In this case JSON/JavaScript can be used by the mini-apps.

Code generation is an example of solution instantiation and may be a part of solution instantiation. This section explains an approach which allows parallel evolution of the source models and the generated/instantiated solution with ability to re-instantiate a solution from the model preserving the changes made in the instantiated solution after it was instantiated. For example, manual edits in source files. Creating a solution instantiator requires effort and as such there is a break-even point between instantiating solutions manually and building an automated solution instantiator to instantiate them repeatedly. In other words, solution instantiators shall be used to instantiate &ldquo;sibling&rdquo; solutions aiming to solve &ldquo;commonly occuring problems&rdquo;, that is - instantiate patterns. Steps Pattern Define and publish a pattern. Pattern documentation shall specify &ldquo;variation points&rdquo; - what can be different between different instances. E.g. cache or database or a number of replicas. Patterns shall be defined by subject matter experts. For example a cloud solution pattern shall be defined by people with a deep experience with cloud technologies, e.g. a cloud architecture group. A pattern may be elicited from one or more one-off solutions with a significant overlap in functionality. A published pattern has a value on its own without a solution instantiatior. An instantiator may be created at a later point of time once the pattern has demonstrated its usefulness. The pattern shall be treated as a product with releases and release numbers. It may be stored in a version control system. Reference implementation(s) Build a reference implementation demonstrating that the pattern &ldquo;holds water&rdquo;. The reference implementation doesn&rsquo;t have to externalize the variation points, but it shall document them. There might be several reference implementations for a single pattern demonstrating different combinations of variation points. A reference implementation shall also be built and maintained by subject matter experts, not necessarily the same people who created the pattern1, e.g. cloud developers. As well as a pattern a reference implementation shall be treated as a product with releases and release numbers which can include pattern release numbers. There might be several releases of a reference implementation per pattern release. Documentation for reference implementations may be &ldquo;mounted&rdquo; under the pattern documentation so it is easy to find. Instantiation and Configuration models Once a reference implementation is published it can be converted into two models. Instantiation model Instantiation model is created with Nasdanika Exec and reflects the constant part of the reference implementation which is parameterized by the configuration model. Additional execution participants can be created as needed. Such participants may leverage existing generation solutions, e.g. Spring Initializr - out of the box or customized to organization&rsquo;s needs. Nasdanika Execution Model supports rollbacks, which can be important for instantiation of complex solutions where one of instantiation steps may fail - in this case the instantiator will clean up after itself. Configuration model The configuration model contains variation points. It may be quite involved with conditional logic and validations, e.g. lookups in internal registries. It is also likely that different parts of the configuration model would have to be populated by different roles within the organization with different authorities. In this case the model may leverage some kind of signing or authentication tokens/permits which can be validated at the instantiation time. Such permits may have an expiration date. Configuration models may be stored in different formats and edited in a variety of ways. One way to create a configuration model is to use Eclipse EMF and one way to load the model is from YAML using Nasdanika Core EMF. If a configuration model is stored in YAML in Git one way to validate authority at the instantiation time is to check who&rsquo;s committed a particular configuration file or changed a particular line of code (using blame). In this case, for example, if a developer modifies a configuration element which is supposed to be modified by an architect the instantiation will fail. Instantiate The instantiation process will: Load and validate the instantiation model. Load and validate the configuration model. Execute the instantiation flow as explained in the &ldquo;Nasdanika Execution Model&rdquo; mentioned above: Diagnose Execute Commit or Rollback Close The instantiation process (or some of its parts) can be tested using the reference implementation(s) - given a specific input it shall produce the same resources as in the reference implementation. Example A web wizard is used to collect user input to create a new cloud application. The input collecting application creates a request YAML file and pushes it to a Git repository. An automated build job is triggered by the push. It inspects the commit message and starts the instantiation process passing the configuration YAML to it is as input. The process: Creates Git repositories. Generates code and pushes to the repositories. Creates build jobs and triggers a build to the development environment. Evolution Once a solution is instantiated there are three parts which may evolve independently: The instantiation model - there might be a new release of the underlying pattern or reference implementation and the model may get updated. The configuration model, e.g. it might be decided to use a different caching solution. The instantiated solution - developers will modify the generated code to implement business functionality. The solution instantiator merges the changes in the three &ldquo;evolution streams&rdquo; as explained below. It re-executes the instantiation process. For every resource (file, repository, database) the instantiation model would specify a Reconcile Action - what to do if the resource already exists. In case of Merge the instantiator would do the following: Check if the resource was modified since the last instantiation. For version-controlled files one way to do it is to use jGit and see who last committed the file. If the committer ID is the same ID which is used for instantiation that would mean that the file was not touched and can be overwritten. If the resource was modified use a merger applicable for the resource format. For Java resources there is JMerge which detects manual changes using @generated JavaDoc tags - it overwrites only classes and members with such tag present. Other file resources can be merged using a 3-way patch in a version-controlled environment, which is2: Find the previous generated revision - go through the commit history, find a commit done by the generator ID. Another option is use a comment convention, e.g. look for something like Generated by &lt;Generator Maven coordinates&gt;. Do a diff between the previous and the newly generated code and create a patch. There are Java libraries to do diff/patch for text files and for formats such as JSON and XML. If there is no difference do nothing - keep the current revision as it is. Otherwise apply the patch to the current revision. The re-instantiation process can be performed automatically on Git push, similarly to how the first instantiation happens. In fact, it will be the same process with no pre-existing resources for the first instantiation. One variation of a reconcile action for Git repositories may be &ldquo;create a branch&rdquo; - the instantiator would not commit changes to the same branch, but would create another branch. Then a build may be triggered off that branch and if it is successful and all tests pass then the branch maybe merged into the original branch or a pull request may be created. If the build fails, then the development team would be notified to review and fix problems caused by a merge. Value proposition Developers are inherently better at writing code than documentation - they wouldn&rsquo;t be developers but rather technical writers otherwise. With a well-established solution instantiation practice it might be easier and faster for developers to create solution instantiators than to create a detailed documentation for reference implementations. Instantiators are code and can be tested faster and cheaper than documentation. Solution instantiators shall produce the same result when given the same input. It is not always true for people. Extensibility - there might be &ldquo;base&rdquo; instantiators which define extension points to allow customization. It may be leveraged in a large organization where a central team produces such &ldquo;base&rdquo; instantiators and then business line/department teams customize them to their needs. The same approach can be applied to configuration models using template/prototype chains - a config model can define template/prototype or multiple templates/prototypes similar to how docker images define base image using FROM. Or necessarily not the same people to prove that the pattern can be instantiated based on the published documentation. ? This is one option. Another option is to diff/patch between the previously generated and the current revision and then apply the patch to the newly generated content. ?

These classes can be categorized as follows: General purpose - helper classes such as EMFUtil. Adapters and adapter factories - base classes for building (reflective) adapters and composite adapter factories in order to adapt Ecore models to required functionality. Model execution - base classes for &ldquo;wiring&rdquo; Ecore models into the Nasdanika Execution Model, i.e. making the models executable including command line execution. Persistence - classes for loading Ecore models from key-value data sources with special support of YAML. Adapters Adapter factories Model execution Persistence Load keys Features Classes and packages Default feature Full definition Short definition Single line Multi-line Loading references Reference keys (EKeys) Value feature File sets String Array Map Mutually exclusive features Load tracker Marker Examples MS Excel resources Adapters Adapters mechanism allows to adapt a model element to another type. Adapters are used by, say HTML Flow to adapt Core Flow to org.nasdanika.html.model.app.util.ActionProviders in order to generate an action model and then generate a web site from the action model. Adapters allow to separate concerns and to have multiple adapters and adapter factories for the same model. For example, an action model can be transformed to a static web site or Eclipse help using different adapters. Adapters are created by adapter factories which are registered with a resource set. Below is a code snippet demonstrating the process of transforming a flow model to an action model by adapting the root model element to ActionProvider and then creating an Action instance: // Create a resource set and load a model\nResourceSet instanceModelsResourceSet = createResourceSet();\nResource instanceModelResource = instanceModelsResourceSet.getResource(URI.createURI(&quot;mymodel.xml&quot;), true);\n\n// Add an adapter factory\ninstanceModelsResourceSet.getAdapterFactories().add(new EngineeringActionProviderAdapterFactory(context)); {\n\n// Resource set for a target (action) model\t\t\nResourceSet actionModelsResourceSet = createResourceSet();\nactionModelsResourceSet.getResourceFactoryRegistry().getExtensionToFactoryMap().put(org.eclipse.emf.ecore.resource.Resource.Factory.Registry.DEFAULT_EXTENSION, new XMIResourceFactoryImpl());\n\t\t\norg.eclipse.emf.ecore.resource.Resource actionModelResource = actionModelsResourceSet.createResource(URI.createURI(&quot;myactions.xml&quot;));\n\n// Getting the root object of the source model\t\t\nEObject instance = instanceModelResource.getContents().get(0);\n\n// Adapting the root to ActionProvider and calling execute() to obtain an action\nAction rootAction = EObjectAdaptable.adaptTo(instance, ActionProvider.class).execute(...);\n\n// Adding the root action to a resource and then saving to a file\nactionModelResource.getContents().add(rootAction);\nactionModelResource.save(null);\n Adapter factories Below is a summary of Nasdanika EMF adapters: org.nasdanika.emf.ComposeableAdapterFactory - an interface for factories which can be composed into a ComposedAdapterFactory (see below). org.nasdanika.emf.ComposedAdapterFactory - a factory which delegates to its children. This factory is also composeable, i.e. it is possible to build a hierarchy of adapter factories. org.nasdanika.emf.DelegatingAdapterFactory - base class for adapter factories which create a delegate object and then create a dynamic proxy which implements org.eclipse.emf.common.notify.Adapter and all interfaces of the delegate. It allows to create adapters without having to implement Adapter or extend org.eclipse.emf.common.notify.AdapterImpl. org.nasdanika.emf.BiFunctionAdapterFactory - creates an adapter using a java.util.function.BiFunction, e.g. a constructor with two parameters. The first parameter is the notifier (target model element), the second is the factory. org.nasdanika.emf.FunctionAdapterFactory - creates an adapter using a java.util.function.Function, e.g. a single parameter constructor. The parameter is the notifier (target model element). org.nasdanika.emf.InstanceAdapterFactory - delegates to a single shared adapter instance for all notifiers (target model elements). org.nasdanika.emf.SupplierAdapterFactory - delegates to java.util.function.Supplier, which can be a no-argument constructor. In this case each notifier/element gets its own adapter instance. However, that instance is not aware of the notifier (target element). Such adapters can be used for collecting computation results. See JavaDoc for more details. Model execution Nasdanika EMF provides the following CLI command classes: org.nasdanika.emf.ResourceSetCommand - base class for commands which use a set of resources (models). org.nasdanika.emf.ModelCommand - loads a model from a URL or a file path, optionally validates and passes to a consumer for further processing. org.nasdanika.emf.AdapterModelCommand - base class for commands which execute models by adapting them to a specific adapter type and then creating a org.nasdanika.common.CommandFactory from that adapter. org.nasdanika.emf.ConsumerModelCommand - base class for commands which adapt models to org.nasdanika.common.ConsumerFactory and then combine input supplier with the consumer to execute the command. org.nasdanika.emf.ExecuteModelCommand - adapts the root model element to CommandFactory and executes it. org.nasdanika.emf.FunctionModelCommand - base class for commands which adapt models to org.nasdanika.common.FunctionFactory and then combine input supplier with the function and output consumer to execute the command. org.nasdanika.emf.SupplierModelCommand - base class for commands which adapt models to org.nasdanika.common.SupplierFactory and then combine the supplier with the output consumer to execute the command. Persistence Nasdanika EMF persistence allows to load Ecore models from key-value sources such as: java.util.Function&lt;String,Object&gt;.apply(String key) JSON YAML Loading from YAML and JSON can be used to implement &lt;problem doman&gt;-as-code: DEefine models in YAML or JSON, Edit in a text editor or in a web browser using version control system Web UI, Store in a version control system, Keep track of model element definition source - file (URI), line, number, origin and commit (see Marker below), Diff and merge as code. The persistence framework uses EAnnotation with urn:org.nasdanika source to customize loading. This annotation is referred further as &ldquo;Nasdanika annotation&rdquo; The persistence framework loads EObject structural features which are: Changeable Not changeable with computed key of Nasdanika annotation set to true - in this case the feature value is loaded from the source, but not injected into the object - it is available via load tracking for custom handling - see below. Load key (see below) is not null. Load keys Features EObject features are loaded using load keys. By default load keys are derived from feature names by converting camel case to kebab case. E.g. firstName becomes first-name. Load key can be customized using the Nasdanika annotation: load-key detail key at the feature level. The value shall be a string. load-keys detail key at the class level. The value shall be a YAML map of feature names to load keys. This approach allows to override feature load key in subclasses. loadable detail key at the feature level - set it to false to suppress loading of features even if they are changeable. Please note that it is different from computed - computed forces loading of values of non-changeable features, and loadable suppresses loading of changeable features. feature-key detail key at the feature level. The value shall be a string. Feature key is used as a fallback value for a load key and also for computing containment path. feature-keys detail key at the class level. The value shall be a YAML map. This annotation can be defined on a subclass of the class defining the feature, which allows to override the default (kebab case) feature key. The above process of resolving load keys is used by the default load key provider. Load keys can be customized by passing a non-default load key provider to org.nasdanika.emf.persistence.EObjectLoader constructor. Classes and packages Default load keys for classes and packages are computed in the same way as for features by converting class or package name from came to kebab case. Default behavior can be customized using the load-key Nasdanika annotation detail key with the load key as value. It is also possible to suppress loading of a class or a package by setting loadable Nasdanika annotation detail key to false. As with features, it is possible to provide a custom key loader to EObjectLoader constructor to change the default behavior if annotations are not enough. A custom key loader may fall-back/chain/delegate to the default key loader. In the below example of loading of Exec Text content-text:\n   description: Full text definition\n   interpolate: false\n   content: Hello ${token}.\n content - Package name converted to kebab case. text - Class name converted to kebab case. description, interpolate, content - object features. Default feature A feature can be defined as a default feature by setting default-feature Nasdanika annotation to true at the feature level or to the feature name at the class level. Default features are used when object configuration value is not a map, e.g. a String. For example, Exec Text defines content as its default feature. It allows to load text from the following YAML specifications: Full definition content-text:\n   description: Full text definition\n   interpolate: false\n   content: Hello ${token}.\n Short definition Just content (default feature): Single line content-text: World\n Multi-line content-text: |+2\n  Line 1.\n  Line 2.\n Loading references By default configuration values of reference elements shall be single-entry maps with the type as a key and a value as configuration. The loading process instantiates an EObject by its key and then injects features from the value. For example,   modules:\n    - engineering-product:\n        path: core\n        name: Core\n        owners: engineering://nasdanika/engineers/joe-doe\n        experts: engineering://nasdanika/engineers/joe-doe\n        action-prototype: &quot;ncore.genmodel.xml#/&quot;\n        releases:\n          &quot;0.1&quot;:\n            name: &quot;0.1&quot;\n            increment: engineering://nasdanika/increments/2021/children/Q4            \n          &quot;1.0&quot;:\n            name: &quot;1.0&quot;\n modules - is an interited reference of Organization (see All &gt; References) engineering-product is the element type - engineering package, product type. path, name, &hellip; are object features In many cases reference values are either of the same type or their type can be derived from their configuration keys. In this case explicitly specifying the type is unnecessary and may lead to configuration errors. For example, in the above code snippet releases reference can contain only instances of its reference type - Release. To specify that the type of refernce elements shall be derived from the reference type or annotations instead of being supplied explicitly set homogenous Nasdanika annotation details key to true on the reference. In some situations the type of reference element can be derived from the type of its configuration - string, integer, map, list, boolean, date. In such cases add reference-type Nasdanika annotation key with a value containing a YAML map of configuration value types to element types. For example: map: MapProperty\nlist: ListProperty\nstring: StringProperty\ninteger: IntegerProperty\n Map values can be strings for types in the same EPackage or maps with the following keys: ns-uri - Namespace URI of the EPackage. name - EClass name. In situations when it is necessary to override reference type in a subclass add reference-types Nasdanika annotation to the subclass. The value shall be a YAML map of reference names to element types. Element types can be strings for the types in the same package or maps with ns-uri and name keys as explained above. By default, if an element value of a homogenous reference is a string then it is treated as a relative URI of a resource from which the element shall be loaded. In this case that resource has to contain type definition. For elements with a default feature this behavior can be modified by setting strict-containment Nasdanika annotation detail to true to treat the string value in configuration as the value of the default feature. In this case it is not possible to load reference elements from external resources. Reference keys (EKeys) References may specify attributes of their types as EKeys. References which specify EKeys can be loaded from maps. Currently only a single EKey is supported. Support of multiple EKeys will be added when needed. When a reference with EKeys is loaded from a map, map entry key is injected into the element object&rsquo;s EKey attributes. The map entry value is used to either set up element features or &ldquo;value feature&rdquo;. Value feature When using EKeys you may want to use map entry value to set a specific feature of the reference element instead of using it to configure the element itself. In this case set value-feature Nasdanika annotation on the reference to the name of the feature which shall be configured with the map entry value. File sets It is possible to load zero or more objects into a reference using fileset: URI schema followed by the file set specification. The specification can be a string, a YAML array, or a YAML map. In some cases if a patterns starts with * it is treated as a YAML alias which would lead to a ScannerException being thrown. To solve it add ./ in front of * e.g. ./*/engineering.yml. String If it is a string, then it is treated as an Ant path pattern. Example: fileset:issues/*.yml Array If it is an array, then elements are treated as Ant path patterns. Example: fileset:[issues/*.yml] Map If it is a map, the following keys are supported: include - a string or an array of strings with Ant path patterns to include into the result. exclude - a string or an array of strings with Ant path patterns to exclude from the matched include result. base - Base directory resolved relative to the context URI. Examples; Single line: fileset:{include:*.yml;exclude:done_*.yml;base:issues} Multi-line:   issues:\n    - |+2\n      fileset:\n        include: \n          - *.yml\n          - *.yaml\n        exclude: done_*.*\n        base: issues\n Mutually exclusive features Features may have exclusive-with Nasdanika annotation details containing a space-separated list of feature keys which are exclusive with the annotated feature. It is not necessary to declare exclusivity on both features, just on one of them. If object configuration contains keys for mutually exclusive features, loading will fail. Load tracker During load a org.nasdanika.common.persistence.LoadTracker adapter is added to objects being loaded. This adapter allows, for example, to compute derived values for features unless they were already loaded. It also allows to access values of computed features - these values are stored in the adapter, but not injected into the target object because these features are not changeable. An example of using a computed feature - the feature type is an object which is loaded from an external system, e.g. an issue tracker. Feature configuration value is a string, e.g. an issue ID. During load issue ID is stored in the load tracker adapter and then is used to contact the issue tracker system, retrieve issue details and create an issue object to be returned from the feature getter. Marker When objects are loaded from YAML information about source file line and number is injected into the objects as follows: An adapter of type org.nasdanika.common.persistence.Marked is added to the object. If the object extends Marked, then Marker is added to the object. It is possible to customize marker type by calling EObjectLoader.setMarkerFactory(). For example, GitMarker can be created with org.nasdanika.emf.persistence.GitMarkerFactory. Examples For examples see Exec tests. MS Excel resources Loading models from MS Excel resources can be done with org.nasdanika.emf.persistence.ExcelResourceFactory class. This class takes care of reading and updating the workbook on save. Loading of model elements from sheets and rows shall be implemented by subclasses. You can find an example/test case in TestExcel."},"modules/core/modules/diagram/modules/model/Style.html":{"path":"Products/Core/Diagram/Model/Style","action-uuid":"8e8762a6-010e-45a6-8d8b-a5599b1d712a","title":"Style","content":"org.nasdanika.diagram.Style Base class for diagram elements and connections with common style features.

Increments can be organized into a hierarchy. For example, year, quarter, month. Increments are used for roadmapping and progress tracking. One approach to using increments is a logarithmic scale, e.g. if it is Jan 2021, then define months for Q1 2021, the rest of the quarters for 2021, and just 2022. As time progresses and Q2 approaches - define months for Q2 and reschedule whatever was planned for Q2 to its months. Then, as a month approaches, set end dates for releases and issues.

The execution process consists of the following steps: Create a participant factory (org.nasdanika.common.ExecutionParticipantFactory). Factories can be composed as explained in the subsequent sections. Create an instance of org.nasdanika.common.Context. Pass the context to the factory create() method to create a participant. Create an instance of org.nasdanika.common.ProgressMonitor. Walk the participant through the lifecycle methods. All lifecycle methods except execute() have the same signature for all paricipant types. diagnose() - performs diagnostic of the participant configuration and returns org.nasdanika.common.Diagnostic. If the diagnostic status is ERROR further execution is aborted. Diagnose may prepare the participant for further execution by initializing internal structures, e.g. resolving URL&rsquo;s. However, this method shall not perform any modifications in resources which might have to be rolled back, e.g. it shall not create or delete files or database records. The default implementation returns status SUCCESS. execute() - Executes participant&rsquo;s logic. May modify resources, e.g. write to files, create database records. Different participant types have different signatures of this method. There is no default implementation for this method. commit() - Commits changes performed by execute() if all execution participants were executed successfully, i.e. without throwing an exception. The default implementation does nothing. rollback() - Rolls back changes performed by execute() if some other participant executed after this one has thrown an exception. Returns boolean value indicating whether rollback was successful or not. The default implementation does nothing and returns true. close() - Releases any resources used during execution. E.g. closes database connections, shuts down executor pulls. Overrides close() in java.lang.AutoCloseable so participants can be used in try-with-resources. The default implementation does nothing. Execution participant types org.nasdanika.common.Supplier&lt;T&gt; - T execute(ProgressMonitor) - returns value. org.nasdanika.common.Function&lt;T,R&gt; - R execute(T,ProgressMonitor) - takes an argument and returns value. org.nasdanika.common.Consumer&lt;T&gt; - void execute(T,ProgressMonitor) - takes an argument, does not return value. org.nasdanika.common.Command - void execute(ProgressMonitor) Composition Execution participants can be composed using subclasses of org.nasdanika.common.CompoundExecutionParticipant. Result producing participants - suppliers and functions - can be composed as lists or maps. Consumers can be composed as list and maps. Commands are always composed as lists. Chaining Result producing participants (supplier and function) and their factories have then method which takes value-consuming participant (function or consumer) and returns a participant (or a factory for such a participant) which executes the first participant, takes the returned value and passes it to the second participant. The participants can be chained as follows: Supplier&lt;T&gt;.then(Function&lt;? super T,R&gt;) -&gt; Supplier&lt;R&gt; Supplier&lt;T&gt;.then(Consumer&lt;? super T&gt;) -&gt; Command Function&lt;T,R&gt;.then(Function&lt;? super R,V&gt;) -&gt; Function&lt;T,V&gt; Function&lt;T,R&gt;.then(Consumer&lt;? super R&gt;) -&gt; Consumer&lt;T&gt; asFunction Suppler and Consumer have asFunction methods and their factories have asFunctionFactory methods to allow chaining of supplier and consumer execution. For suppliers asFunction method returns org.nasdanika.common.BiSupplier with the function argument available via getFirst() method and the supplier result via getSecond(). For consumers asFunction creates a pass-through function which executes the consumer and then returns its argument. Contextification Contextification is a form of chaining of execution participant factories where the first factory is a SupplierFactory&lt;Context&gt;. Context returned by the first factory&rsquo;s supplier is passed to the execution participant created by the second factory. Contextification is done using contextify() method of execution participant factories. Bridging to java.util.function Execution participants have static fromXXX methods for constructing from objects implementing java.util.function interfaces, e.g. java.util.function.Function. Utility methods org.nasdanika.common.Util class contains methods for walking execution participants through their lifecycle (call methods) as well as helper execution participant factories. Client code Client code shall walk the top-level execution participant through the lifecycle methods. Composition and chaining classes methods take care of invoking lifecycle methods of their constituents. The below code snippet shows how to call Supplier: Context context = ...;\t\t\nSupplierFactory&lt;InputStream&gt; supplierFactory = ...;\nProgressMonitor monitor = ...;\n\ntry (Supplier&lt;InputStream&gt; supplier = supplierFactory.create(context); ProgressMonitor progressMonitor = monitor.split(&quot;Calling &quot; + supplier.name(), 3 * supplier.size())) {\n\tDiagnostic diagnostic = supplier.splitAndDiagnose(progressMonitor);\n\tif (diagnostic.getStatus() == Status.ERROR) {\n\t\t// Handle diagnostic error - dump to console or log, throw an exception or return error code or status.\n\t\tdiagnostic.dump(System.err, 4);\n\t\t// Calling JUnit.fail() here\n\t\tfail(&quot;Supplier diagnostic failed: &quot; + diagnostic.getMessage());\n\t}\n\t\t\t\n\ttry {\n\t\tInputStream result = supplier.splitAndExecute(progressMonitor);\n\t\t// process result here\n\t\t...\n\t\tsupplier.splitAndCommit(progressMonitor);\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t} catch (Exception e) {\n\t\t// Rollback and handle exception. \n\t\t// In some cases diagnostic exception may be thrown during execution.\n\t\tif (e instanceof DiagnosticException) {\n\t\t\t((DiagnosticException) e).getDiagnostic().dump(System.err, 4);\n\t\t}\n\t\tif (supplier.splitAndRollback(progressMonitor)) {\n\t\t\tfail(&quot;Exception &quot; + e + &quot;, rollback successful&quot;);\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t// Automated cleanup failed - perhaps notify somebody/something to performs manual/external cleanup\n\t\t\tfail(&quot;Exception &quot; + e + &quot;, rollback failed&quot;);\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}"},"modules/core/modules/flow/issues/style-inheritance-from-templates/index.html":{"path":"Products/Core/Flow/Issues/Artifact inheritance of representation properties from templates","action-uuid":"e5c9b71c-c778-4301-9bad-532f7f344d7f","title":"Artifact inheritance of representation properties from templates","content":"Origin flow/engineering/engineering.yml 52:5 Uri engineering://nasdanika/modules/core/modules/flow/issues/style-inheritance-from-templates Target Flow Workable Cascading inheritance, merging of properties.

Application models can be defined manually, e.g. in YAML using Nasdanika EMF Persistence (example), or created programmatically, for example generated from other models. These approaches can be combined. Examples: This site is generated from an engineering model with Ecore model documentation action models generated from Ecore models using Nasdanika HTML Ecore and &ldquo;mounted&rdquo; to the engineering model action tree. TOGAF ADM site is generated from a flow model. To create action models programmatically add app-model dependency to pom.xml, e.g. &lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;org.nasdanika.html&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;app-model&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;2022.4.2&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n to generate HTML form action models add add app-model-gen dependency, e.g. &lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;org.nasdanika.html&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;app-model-gen&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;2022.4.2&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n Concepts Action UI life cycle Action types Page structure Header Root navigation Principal Principal navigation Navigation Panel Content Panel Breadcrumb Title Active action navigation Content left navigation panel Content float left navigation panel Content right navigation panel Content float right navigation panel Section Section title Section navigation Section left navigation panel Section float left navigation panel Section right navigation panel Section float right navigation panel Footer Generation Static sites Dynamic behavior Server-side Client-side Concepts With Nasdanika App model user interface is constructed from actions organized in a hierarchy. Users activate actions to get results (action content). This approach allows developers to focus on the functionality of their application in terms of actions and select action placement in the UI and page styling/themes later. Changing of the action placement does not change the application functionality, just the appearance. It allows to adjust the application as it evolves. For example, an action of a documentation site might be in a section collection if it doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of content and then can be moved to the children collection if it becomes large enough to be a page on its own. Action UI life cycle In the UI an action goes through the following stages: Display - an action link is displayed to the user. The link may have an icon, text or both. It may have a tooltip. Inline actions don&rsquo;t go through this stage - they go directly to the last stage. Some actions are always visible to the user, e.g. the root and principal actions (see below). Some are only shown in a context of another active action, e.g. navigation and section actions. Activation - user clicks on the action link. Actions may have URL, script, and modal activators. URL activator navigates to a URL, script activator executes a script, and a modal activator shows action content in a modal dialog. Display of action content. At this stage action content is displayed to the user. For inline actions content is displayed where the link is displayed for non-inline actions. If an action has a modal activator, then its content is displayed in a modal dialog. Otherwise, action&rsquo;s content is displayed in the content panel. Section actions do not have activators and are displayed in the content panel of their parent action. Action types An application page is generated from 3 actions: Root action - the root of the action hierarchy. It is displayed in the header with its children, except the first one, displayed in the root navigation bar on the top right. On this page &ldquo;Nasdanika&rdquo; is the root action. Navigation actions of the root action are displayed in the footer. Principal action - by default the first child of the root action. Displayed in the navigation bar brand on the left. On this page &ldquo;Documentation&rdquo; is the principal action. Navigation actions of the principal action are displayed in the navigation bar on the right of the principal action. Children of the principal action are displayed recursively in the navigation panel. On this page it is a tree of documentation actions. Active action - any action in the hierarchy which is currently &ldquo;active&rdquo;, i.e. it&rsquo;s content is displayed in the content panel and it is shown as active/selected in the navigation panel or navigation bar. On this page Products/HTML/Models/Application/Model is the active action - it is selected in the navigation tree and your are reading its content. Active action path is displayed in the breadcrumb. Navigation actions of the active action are displayed in in the active action navigation bar to the right of the action title - &ldquo;Diagram&rdquo;, &ldquo;Issues&rdquo;, and &ldquo;All Issues&rdquo; on this page. Section actions are displayed as page sections with their navigation actions displayed in section navigation bars to the right of section titles (for paragraph section style). Content/Section (float) left actions are displayed in the left content/section (float) navigation panel. Content/Section (float) right actions are displayed in the right content/section (float) navigation panel. Page structure This section provides an overview of the page structure. You can hover over the diagram elements to see tooltips and click on the diagram elements to navigate to corresponding documentation sections. You may also hide/show diagram layers. Header Displays the root action&rsquo;s icon and text. Click on the icon/text activates the root action, if it has an activator. Root navigation Displays 1+ children of the root action - siblings of the principal action. Principal Displays the principal&rsquo;s action icon and text. Click on the icon/text activates the principal action, if it as an activator. Principal navigation Displays navigation actions of the principal action. Navigation Panel Displays children of the principal action. Navigation panels can display actions in several modes - list, tree, cards, cards with list or tree. Cards can be collapsible. This page uses collapsible cards with trees. Content Panel Displays content of the active action. Breadcrumb Containment path of the active action. Title Icon and text of the active action. Active action navigation Displays navigation actions of the active action. If a navigation action has children and no activator it is rendered as a drop-down. This also applies to the root, footer, and section navigation actions. Content left navigation panel Displays leftNavigation actions of the active action. Left navigation panel is displayed in a bootstrap column. It can be used to display, for example, a table of contents of the active action - the hierarchy of sections. Content float left navigation panel Displays floatLeftNavigation actions of the active action. Left navigation panel is displayed in a div with float style. Similarly to the content left panel it can be used to display, for example, a table of contents of the active action - the hierarchy of sections. Content right navigation panel Displays rightNavigation actions of the active action. Right navigation panel is displayed in a bootstrap column. It can be used to display, for example, a list of useful links. Content float right navigation panel Displays floatRightNavigation actions of the active action. Right navigation panel is displayed in a div with float style. Similarly to the content right panel it can be used to display, for example, a list of useful links. Section Actions may have zero or more sections. Action may define how sections shall be displayed by specifying SectionStyle. Sections can be nested. A section is rendered in the same way as the active action, but without breadcrumb. Section title Icon and text of the section action. Section navigation Displays navigation actions of the section action. Section left navigation panel Displays leftNavigation actions of the section action. Left navigation panel is displayed in a bootstrap column. Section float left navigation panel Displays floatLeftNavigation actions of the section action. Left navigation panel is displayed in a div with float style. Section right navigation panel Displays rightNavigation actions of the section action. Right navigation panel is displayed in a bootstrap column. Section float right navigation panel Displays floatRightNavigation actions of the section action. Right navigation panel is displayed in a div with float style. Footer Displays navigation actions of the root action. Generation HTML pages are generated from actions by combining the action model with a page template. Example of a page template Static sites Static sites are generated by traversing the action model and generating pages for action with location matching a specific condition, e.g. located under a specified output directory. The generation process is two-step: Resource model is generated from an action model - example Files are generated from the resource model - example, includes validation of links and generation of a search index. Dynamic behavior This section explains how to create a dynamic web application with Nasdanika action models. The dynamic behavior approaches can be combined with each other and with static web site generation. Server-side Server-side dynamic behavior can be implemented by creating a servlet or another type of Java HTTP request processor, e.g. a Spring RestController. An action model can be generated or loaded from some resource and stored in HTTP session. Then individual pages would be generated on access. The action model can be re-generated on specific events, e.g. user log-in/log-out or changes in data which affect the model content. If the action model is highly dynamic, it can be generated for every request instead of caching it in session. The dynamic part of a page (page content) can be injected via a context property. Some other options: Generate a page with a replacement token in the content panel. Cache the page in session. During request processing use String replace. Generate a page with an empty content panel. Parse the page using Jsoup and store the parsed document and the content panel element in session. During request processing replace content of the content panel element with dynamic content, write to response. If the action model is constant and only the content panel shall be dynamic, then the server-side dynamic generation can be combined with static site generation: the static part would be hosted on a web server such as Apache HTTPD and dynamic requests would be forwarded to a servlet container. Client-side Another option to introduce dynamic behavior is single page applications, e.g. built with: Vue.js and BootstrapVue. The search page of this site is created using this approach - the generation process creates search-documents.js file used by a Vue application. React and React Bootstrap. The client-side approach may be combined with the server-side approach - instead of application pages the server side would generate json responses used by the client side. Or it may generate both - an application page with a Vue/React application on it possibly parameterized during generation, and then json responses with data for the application. The server site may provide update endpoints for the single-page application as well.

If returned graph is not null then its model gets encoded. Optionally replace the original file with the processed one if file URI. Default implementation iterates over all cells and passes them to a cell processing/filtering method. The cell processing method shall return boolean to indicate that the cell was changed. The graph processing method shall return the same graph if any of the cells were modified or null. URI processing - if a cell has uri attribute - resolve, set relative links. If there is style - merge. Element style overrides uri style entries. Size - boolean property to indicate that cell shall be resized if element at the URI specifies size. This approach would allow to create manual diagrams referencing existing model elements and have a consistent appearance of diagram elements across multiple diagrams. Also element look will be automatically updated on all diagrams if it changes. Sync boolean property in diagram elements and diagrams - if true the diagram (representation) and the element shall be updated when the backing model changes, e.g. label, or deleted if the element is not present in the model anymore. True by default, can be set to false by the modeler in the model (YAML) or in Drawio editor. URI is used for correlation. Perhaps sync may be a list of what should be synced with true meaning all, false nothing and a comma-separated list for fine-grained definitions. For example, it might be needed to update style if it was generated from the model and the model definition changed. One option of deling with style is to compute style digest during generation and store as a property. Update style only if the style was not changed since last generation, i.e. computed digest is the same as stored digest. In this case sync style would have some value e.g. sync=style=unmodified;label=true - i.e. sync style only if it was not changed manually and always update label. May use the same approach for label - label-digest (or hash) property. Users can force update of style or label by removing/clearing respective -hash property. One more aspect of processing is validation. E.g. validation of links, especially relative links."},"modules/html/modules/models/modules/html/modules/model/StylesheetReference.html":{"path":"Products/HTML/Models/HTML/Model/StylesheetReference","action-uuid":"f0a57868-0dd1-49cc-81ce-c0b9be743cb0","title":"StylesheetReference","content":"org.nasdanika.html.model.html.StylesheetReference Reference to an external stylesheet.
