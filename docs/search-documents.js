The enterprise model provides deeper insight on the WHY in general. The practices are organized into an enterprise continuum from the most generic on the left to the most specific on the right. However, the most specific on the right is still generic and needs to be specialized for a particular application (embodiment): Analysis, Visualization &amp; Generation - describes a general approach on using Nasdanika products. Java Analysis, Visualization &amp; Generation - application of the above to the Java model1 Loading and analyzing Java sources and bytecode, generation of non-Java artifacts such as HTML reports Generation of Java sources. JUnit test generation for low coverage methods - further specialization of the Java practice to identify methods with low test coverage using the Coverage Model and then generate JUnit tests for those methods using the Java model and OpenAI. You can think of the three practices above as progressive &ldquo;binding of decision&rdquo; as you move from the left to the right to reach &ldquo;executability&rdquo; - ability to deliver value. A java analogy for progressive specialization would be incremental binding of generic types as exemplified below: Map&lt;K,V&gt; - generic map. MyMap&lt;K extends Comparable&gt; extends Map&lt;&lt;K, MyValue&lt;K&gt;&gt; - the above map bound to a single generic parameter with an upper bound. It is a specialization of the above generic map which is also generic. Some decisions were bound, but there are still decisions to be bound. MyMap&lt;String&gt; theMap = ...; - fully bound map. Decisions are bound at variation point. For example, &ldquo;storage&rdquo; is a variation point, &ldquo;blob storage&rdquo; is one of alternatives, decision to use &ldquo;blob storage&rdquo; binds the variation point to a specific alternative. Decision binding forms a graph. Once you bind, say, &ldquo;storage&rdquo; variation point, some downstream alternatives may become unavailable because they are incompatible with that binding. Some might be available, but make no sense. For example, a decision to send data unencrypted over a public network is compatible with a decision to purchase some additional strong encryption hardware to use on-prem, but does it make business sense? Different alternatives feature different &ldquo;quality attributes&rdquo; - performance, reliability, cost. As the number of variation points and alternatives grows purely human-based decision making becomes inefficient. In this case variation points can be modeled as requirements and alternatives as capability providers or capabilities with quality attributes (seecapability). After this a list of &ldquo;designs&rdquo; (a.k.a. &ldquo;provisioning plans&rdquo;) can be created. A design/provisioning plan is a collection of compatible capabilities. If a list of designs is short enough it can be analyzed by humans directly. In the case of long lists or a large number of very similar designs decision analysis can be employed for making a selection of a design which is best fit for purpose. The page provides a general overview and the book goes into more details. ↩"},"core/emf/index.html":{"path":"Core/EMF","action-uuid":"d40c01ee-387c-433f-896c-b5d6b53e84b3","title":"EMF","content":"TODO"},"html/models/html/index.html":{"path":"HTML/Models/HTML","action-uuid":"72de939d-578e-46be-b1a2-8dca7ad2c32e","title":"HTML","content":"TODO"},"index.html":{"action-uuid":"41031668-7aca-45f0-b554-616f2398c517","title":"Nasdanika","content":" Common Resources Persistence Ncore Diagram Graph Drawio EMF Exec Maven Capability CLI Launcher Core HTML HTML Bootstrap App Models JsTree Bootstrap EMF HTML GitLab Family Architecture Git Excel ECharts Nature Bank PDF Party Coverage Source Engineering Java Maven Enterprise Function Flow Rules Azure Decision Analysis Capability Flow Ecore Jira Models Data Sources Loader Store Key Extractor Query Engine Requestor Generator Responder Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Analysis, Visualization &amp; Generation Java Analysis, Visualization &amp; Generation JUnit Tests Generation Practices Beyond Diagrams Java Analysis, Visualization, and Generation Books CLI Common Resources Persistence Ncore Diagram Graph Drawio EMF Exec Maven Capability CLI Launcher Core HTML HTML Bootstrap App Models JsTree Bootstrap EMF HTML GitLab Family Architecture Git Excel ECharts Nature Bank PDF Party Coverage Source Engineering Java Maven Enterprise Function Flow Rules Azure Decision Analysis Capability Flow Ecore Jira Models Data Sources Loader Store Key Extractor Query Engine Requestor Generator Responder Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Analysis, Visualization &amp; Generation Java Analysis, Visualization &amp; Generation JUnit Tests Generation Practices Beyond Diagrams Java Analysis, Visualization, and Generation Books CLI"},"core/launcher/index.html":{"path":"Core/Launcher","action-uuid":"e290fc8c-b7bd-4861-8057-39c58f5ca1d9","title":"Launcher","content":"This module provides an executable jar which is used for launching Core CLI Application and can be customized to launching other classes.

In particular: Generation of tests for methods or classes with low test coverage Leveraging Gen AI such as OpenAI ChatGPT or Azure OpenAI Service for test generation The above diagram shows Java development activities and artifacts. Black arrows show the typical process, blue arrows show the test generation loop. The developer produces source artifacts which may include non-java artifacts used to generate Java code (e.g. Ecore models), &ldquo;main&rdquo; Java sources and test Java sources. Java sources are compiled into bytecode (class files). Here it is important to note that matching of bytecode classes and methods to source code classes and methods might be non-trivial because of: Lambdas Anonymous and method-scope classes Annotation processors like Lombok JUnit tests are compiled and executed. If code coverage, such as jacoco, is configured then test execution produces coverage data. Jacoco stores coverage data in jacoco.exec file. This file is used to generate a coverage report and upload coverage information to systems like SonarQube. In this practice it is also used to select which methods to generate tests for based on coverage data. This diagram provides an insight into the test generation activity: Coverage data and bytecode are used as input to load the Coverage model. Source files, the coverage model, and bytecode (optional) are used to load the Java model of source code. The generator traverses the model and generates unit tests for method with low coverage using a combination of programmatic (traditional) generation and Gen AI. Tests are generated as a Java model as well and then are delivered to the developer for review, modification, and inclusion into the unit test suite. The following section provides an overview of two &ldquo;local loop&rdquo; reference implementations (a.k.a. designs/embodiments) - all-in-one and componentized. There are many possible designs leveraging different alternatives at multiple variation points. The sections after the reference implementations section provide an overview of variation points, alternatives, and factors to take into consideration during alternative selection. Reference Implementations All-in-one Componentized Repository scan/crawl Variation points and alternatives Stakeholders &amp; Activities Developer Build machine Test generator GenAI Messages Channels Developer -&gt; Build Machine/Test Generation : Source code Build Machine -&gt; Test Generator : Coverage results, possibly with bytecode Test Generation -&gt; Developer : Generated tests Test Generation - GenAI : Prompt Reference Implementations This section explains reference implementations All-in-one All-in-one generations is implemented as a JUnit test is available in TestGenerator. An example of tests generated by this generator - PetControllerTests. As the name implies, all steps of source analysis and generation are implemented in a single class and are executed in one go. Componentized Componentized test generation which is also executed in one go is implemented in these classes: TestJavaAnalyzers - loads sources, coverage, and inspectors, passes the sources to the inspectors, aggregates and saves results. Coverage Inspector - generates tests for methods with low coverage leveraging TestGenerator capability provided by OpenAITestGenerator. Repository scan/crawl TestGitLab demonstrates how to scan a source repository (GitLab) using REST API, inspect code, generate unit tests, commit them to the server (also over the REST API) and create a merge request. This implementation does not use coverage information, its purpose is to demonstrate operation over the REST API without having to clone a repository, which might be an expensive operation. The implementation uses GitLab Model to communicate with the repository. It uses Java model to load sources and StringBuilder to build test cases. Variation points and alternatives As you have seen above, you can have an AI-powered JUnit test generator in about 230 lines of code, and maybe it would all you need. However, there are many variation points (design dimensions), alternatives at each point and, as such, possible permutations of thereof (designs). This section provides a high level overview of variation points and alternatives. How to assemble a solution from those alternative is specific to your context and there might be different solutions for different contexts and multiple solutions complementing each other. As you proceed with assembling a solution, or a portfolio of solutions, you may identify more variation points and alternatives. To manage the complexity you may use: Enterprise Model for general guidance, Capability framework or Capability model to create a catalog of variation points and alternatives and compute solutions (designs) from them Decision Analysis to select from the computed list of designs Flow to map your development process AS-IS and then augment it with test generation activities at different points. In this section we&rsquo;ll use the below diagram and the concept of an Enterprise with Stakeholders performing activities and exchanging Messages over Channels. The mission of our enterprise is to deliver quality Java code. The loss function to minimize is loss function = cost * risk / business value. For our purposes we&rsquo;ll define risk as inversely proportional to tests coverage risk = missed lines / total lines - that&rsquo;s all we can measure in this simple model. The cost includes resources costs - salary, usage fees for OpenAI. Below is a summary of our enterprise: Stakeholders &amp; Activities: Developer - writes code Build machine - compiles code and executes tests Test generator - generates unit tests GenAI - leveraged by the Test Generator Messages: Source code Bytecode Coverage results Prompt to generate a test Generated tests Channels Developer -&gt; Build Machine : Source code Developer -&gt; Test Generation : Source code Build Machine -&gt; Test Generator : Coverage results, possibly with bytecode Test Generation -&gt; Developer : Generated tests Test Generation - GenAI : Prompt The below sections outline variation points and alternatives for the list items above Stakeholders &amp; Activities Developer A developer writes code - both &ldquo;business&rdquo; and test. They use some kind of an editor, likely an IDE - Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code. Different IDE&rsquo;s come with different sets of plug-ins, including AI assistants. Forcing a developer to switch from their IDE of preference to another IDE is likely to cause considerable productivity drop, at least for some period of time, even if the new IDE is considered superior to the old IDE. So, if you want to switch to another IDE just because it has some plug-in which you like - think twice. Build machine A build machine compiles code and executes tests. Technically, compilation and test execution may be separated in two individual activities. We are not doing it for this analysis because it doesn&rsquo;t carry much relevance to test generation. You can do it for yours. Test generator Test generator generates tests by &ldquo;looking&rdquo; at the source code, bytecode, and code coverage results. Because the source code is a model element representing piece of code (method, constructor, &hellip;), the generator may traverse the model to &ldquo;understand&rdquo; the context. E.g. it may take a look at the method&rsquo;s class, other classes in the module. If the sources are loaded from a version control system, it may take a look at the commits. And if the source model is part of an organization model, it may look at &ldquo;sibling&rdquo; modules and other resources. By analyzing source and bytecode the generator would know methods a given method calls, objects it creates, and also it would know methods calling the method. It will also &ldquo;know&rdquo; branch conditions, e.g. switch cases. Using this information the generator may: Generate comments to help the developer Generate mocks, including constructor and static methods mocks Generate tests for different branches Build a variety of prompts for GenAI The test generator may do the following code generated by GenAI: Add to generated test methods commented out - as it is done in the reference implementations &ldquo;Massage&rdquo; - remove backticks, parse, add imports - generated and implied. In addition to code generation the generator may ask GenAI to explain code and generate recommendations - it will help the developer to understand the source method and possibly improve it along the way. It may also generate dependency graphs and sequence diagrams. GenAI There may GenAI models out there - cloud, self hosted. Which one to use heavily depends on the context. For example, if you have a large codebase with considerable amount of technical debt having an on-prem model may be a good choice because: You may fine-tune it. Even if you don&rsquo;t have tons of GPU power and your model is relatively slow you can crawl you code base, generate tests and deliver them to developers for review and inclusion into test suites. In this scenario your cost is on-prem infrastructure and power. Your savings are not having to pay for GenAI in the cloud and developer productivity if your fined tuned model turns out to be more efficient than a &ldquo;vanilla&rdquo; LLM. There are many other considerations, of course! Messages In this section we&rsquo;ll take a look just at bytecode and coverage results delivered to the test generator. The generator operates on models. As such, bytecode and coverage results can be delivered in a &ldquo;raw&rdquo; format to be loaded to a model by the generator, or pre-loaded to a model and saved to a file. The second option results in fewer files to pass to the test generator. The model file can be in XMI format or in compressed binary. The XMI format is human-readable, the binary format takes less space on disk. Channels Developer -&gt; Build Machine/Test Generation : Source code For local development the build machine is the same machine where developer creates sources. The test generator is also executed on the developer&rsquo;s workstation. As such, the delivery channels is the file system. In the case of CI/CD pipeline/build server such as Jenkins or GitHub Actions, a version control systems is the delivery channel. Build Machine -&gt; Test Generator : Coverage results, possibly with bytecode The test generator needs coverage results. If the coverage results are delivered in the raw form, it also needs bytecode (class files) to make sense of the results. Coverage results can be delivered to the test generator using the following channels: Filesystem Jenkins workspace made available to the test generator over HTTP(S) Binary repository. For example, coverage results might be published to the Maven repository as an assembly along with sources, jar file, and javadoc. They can be published in a raw format or as a model. In this modality the tests generator can get everything it needs from a Maven repository. You can use Maven model or Maven Artifact Resolver API to work with Maven repositories. See also Apache Maven Artifact Resolver. Additional value of storing coverage data in a binary repository is that it can serve as an evidence of code quality stored with the compiled code, not in some other system. Source repository. Traditionally storing derived artifacts in a source repository is frowned upon. However, storage is cheap, GitHub Pages use this approach - so, whatever floats your boat! SonarQube - it doesn&rsquo;t store method level coverage, so the solution would have to operate on the class level and generate test methods for all methods in a class with low coverage. You may have a specialized application/model repository/database and store coverage information there, possibly aligned to your organization structure. Test Generation -&gt; Developer : Generated tests The goal is to deliver generated tests to the developer, make the developer aware that they are available, and possibly track progress of incorporating the generated tests into the test suite. With this in mind, there are the following alternatives/options: Filesystem - for the local loop Source control system - commit, create a merge/pull request. When using this channels you can check if there is already a generated test and whether it needs to be re-generated. If, say, the source method hasn&rsquo;t changed (the same SHA digest), and the generator version and configuration hasn&rsquo;t changed - do not re-generate, it will only consume resources and create &ldquo;noise&rdquo; - the LLM may return a different response, developers will have to spend time understanding what has changed. You may fork a repository instead of creating a branch. This way all work on tests will be done in the forked repository and the source repository will receive pull requests with fully functional tests. Tests can be generated to a separate directory and then copied to the source directory, or they can be generated directly to the source directory. Tests may be generated with @Disabled annotation so they are clearly visible in the test execution tree, and with @Generated annotation to track changes and merge generated and hand-crafted code. Issue tracking system - either attach generated tests to issues, or create a merge request and reference it from the generated issues. In systems like Jira you may create a hierarchy of issues (epic/story), assign components, labels, fix versions, assignees, etc. You may assign different generated tests to different developers based on size and complexity of the source method. E.g. tests for short methods with low complexity can be assigned to junior developers. This alone may give your team a productivity boost! E-mail or other messaging system. Issue trackers and messaging systems may be used to deliver generated documentation while source control will deliver generated tests. Developers will use the generated documentation such as graphs, sequence diagrams and GenAI explanations/recommendations in conjunction with the generated test code. This channel may implement some sort of backpressure by saying &ldquo;it is enough for now&rdquo;, as a human developer would by crying &ldquo;Enough is enough, I have other stories to work on in this sprint!&rdquo;. Generating just enough tests is beneficial in the following ways: Does not overwhelm developers Does not result in a stale generated code waiting to be taken a look at Does not waste resources and time to generate code which nobody would look at in the near future Uses the latest (and hopefully the greatest) generator version With backpressure a question of prioritization/sorting arises - what to work on first? Source methods can be sorted according to: Size/complexity Dependency. E.g. method b (caller) calls method a (callee) One strategy might be to work on callee methods first (method a) to provide a solid foundation. Another is to work on caller methods first because callee methods might be tested along the way. These strategies might be combined - some developers (say junior) may work on callee tests and senior developers may be assigned to test (complex) caller (top level) methods. Also, the top-down approach (callers first) might be better for addressing technical debt accrued over time, while bottom-up (callees first) for new development.

Analysis Java model can be loaded from sources and bytecode. Tests coverage can be loaded from jacoco.exec and class files and associated with model elements.

Bytecode can be instrumented to collect runtime cross-referencing such as reflective method calls and field access. Visualization Module, package, class, method dependency graphs. The graphs may reflect coverage data so they can be used for prioritization of addressing technical debt. For example, many well-covered microservices may use a shared library with low coverage.

Nasdanika capability framework can operate on top of ServiceLoader and may be thought of as a generalization of service loading. In essence, the capability framework is a backward chaining engine as shown in one of the example below. Client code - requesting a capability Capabilities are loaded by CapabilityLoader. Capability loader can take an iterable of capability factories in its constructor, or it can load them using ServiceLoader as shown in the below code snippet: CapabilityLoader capabilityLoader = new CapabilityLoader();\ncapabilityLoader.getFactories().add(new TestServiceFactory&lt;Object&gt;());\nProgressMonitor progressMonitor = new PrintStreamProgressMonitor();\n\t\t\nfor (CapabilityProvider&lt;?&gt; cp: capabilityLoader.load(new TestCapabilityFactory.Requirement(&quot;Hello World&quot;), progressMonitor)) {\n\tSystem.out.println(cp);\n\tFlux&lt;?&gt; publisher = cp.getPublisher();\n\t\t\t\n\tpublisher.subscribe(System.out::println);\n}\n Factories can also be added post-construction with getFactories().add(factory). Service capabilities Service requirements and capabilities provide functionality similar to ServiceLoader - requesting instances of specific type, but extend it with ability to provide additional service requirement. This functionality is provided by ServiceCapabilityFactory and ServiceCapabilityFactory.Requirement. CapabilityLoader capabilityLoader = new CapabilityLoader();\ncapabilityLoader.getFactories().add(new TestServiceFactory&lt;Object&gt;());\nProgressMonitor progressMonitor = new PrintStreamProgressMonitor();\n\t\t\n@SuppressWarnings({ &quot;unchecked&quot;, &quot;rawtypes&quot; })\nServiceCapabilityFactory.Requirement&lt;List&lt;Double&gt;, Double&gt; requirement = (ServiceCapabilityFactory.Requirement) ServiceCapabilityFactory.createRequirement(List.class, null,  33.0);\nfor (CapabilityProvider&lt;?&gt; cp: capabilityLoader.load(requirement, progressMonitor)) {\n\tSystem.out.println(cp);\n\tFlux&lt;?&gt; publisher = cp.getPublisher();\n\t\t\t\n\tpublisher.subscribe(System.out::println);\n}\n It is also possible to load services from ServiceLoader using subclasses of Service. You&rsquo;d need to subclass ServiceFactory in a module which uses a particular service and override stream(Class&lt;S&gt; service) method as shown below: @Override\nprotected Stream&lt;Provider&lt;S&gt;&gt; stream(Class&lt;S&gt; service) {\n\treturn ServiceLoader.load(service).stream();\n}\n Then you&rsquo;d need to add the factory to the loader: capabilityLoader.getFactories().add(new TestServiceFactory&lt;Object&gt;());\n Providing a capability As it was mentioned above, capability factories can be explicitly added to CapabilityLoader or loaded using ServiceLoader. Below is an example of a capability factory: public class TestCapabilityFactory implements CapabilityFactory&lt;TestCapabilityFactory.Requirement, Integer&gt; {\n\t\n\tpublic record Requirement(String value){};\n\t\n\t@Override\n\tpublic boolean canHandle(Object requirement) {\n\t\treturn requirement instanceof Requirement;\n\t}\n\n\t@Override\n\tpublic CompletionStage&lt;Iterable&lt;CapabilityProvider&lt;Integer&gt;&gt;&gt; create(\n\t\t\tRequirement requirement,\n\t\t\tBiFunction&lt;Object, ProgressMonitor, CompletionStage&lt;Iterable&lt;CapabilityProvider&lt;Object&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; resolver,\n\t\t\tProgressMonitor progressMonitor) {\n\t\t\n\t\treturn resolver.apply(MyService.class, progressMonitor).thenApply(cp -&gt; {;\n\t\t\t@SuppressWarnings({ &quot;unchecked&quot;, &quot;rawtypes&quot; })\n\t\t\tFlux&lt;MyService&gt; myServiceCapabilityPublisher = (Flux) cp.iterator().next().getPublisher();\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\treturn Collections.singleton(new CapabilityProvider&lt;Integer&gt;() {\n\t\n\t\t\t\t@Override\n\t\t\t\tpublic Flux&lt;Integer&gt; getPublisher() {\n\t\t\t\t\tFunction&lt;MyService, Integer&gt; mapper = ms -&gt; ms.count(((Requirement) requirement).value());\n\t\t\t\t\treturn myServiceCapabilityPublisher.map(mapper);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t});\n\t}\n\n}\n Applications Services Service capabilities explained above a used by Graph and Function Flow for loading node processors and connection processors for a specific requirement using NodeProcessorFactory and ConnectionProcessorFactory respectively. For example, code generation, execution, simulation. Solutions for architectures One of future application of the capability framework is creation a list of solution alternatives for an architecture/pattern. For example, there might be multiple RAG embodiments with different key types, key extractors, stores, &hellip; Some of &ldquo;design dimensions&rdquo; are listed below: Key type: Bag of words. Multiple options - just words, words with frequency, tokenized words, word stems. Embedding vector - different embedding models, different dimensions. Store - multiple stores for multiple key types. Multiple indexing and retrieval methods. Chunk size, chunk overlap, chunking algorithm. Generator - multiple models and prompts As you can see a number of potential combinations can easily go into thousands or even be infinite. Reactive approach with filtering and sorting may be helpful in selecting a solution which is a good fit for a particular use case - number and type of data sources etc. For example, if the total size of data is under a few gigabytes an in-memory store may be a better choice than, say, an external (vector) database. Also an old good bag of words might be better than embeddings. E.g. it might be cheaper. Solution alternatives may include temporal aspect or monetary aspects. For example, version X of Y is available at time Z. Z might be absolute or relative. Say, Z days after project kick-off or license fee payment. Identified solutions meeting requirements can have different quality attributes - costs (to build, to run), timeline, etc. These quality attributes can be used for solution analysis. E.g. one solution can be selected as a transition architecture and another as the target architecture. Backward chaining Family reasoning demonstrates application of the capability framework as a backward chaining engine. Family relationships such as grandfather and cousin are constructed by requiring and combining relationships such as child and sibling. Stream processing This possible application is similar to backward reasoning. Imagine an algorithmic trading strategy which uses several technical indicators, such as moving averages, to make trading decisions. Such a strategy would submit requirements for technical indicators which would include symbol, indicator configuration, time frame size. Technical indicators in turn would submit a requirement for raw trading data. A technical indicator such as moving average would start publishing its events once it receives enough trading data frames to compute its average. A trading engine would submit a requirement for strategies. A strategy factory may produce multiple strategies with different configurations. The trading engine would perform &ldquo;paper&rdquo; trades, select well-performing strategies and discard ones which perform poorly. This can be an ongoing process - if a strategy deteriorates then it is discarded and a new strategy is requested from strategy publishers - this process can be infinite. AI model training/fine-tuning This application is similar to stream processing and may be combined with backward reasoning. Let&rsquo;s say we want to train a model to answer questions about family relationships for a specific family. For example, &ldquo;Who is Alan&rsquo;s great grandmother?&rdquo; A single relationship in the model can be expressed in multiple ways in natural language. And multiple relationships can be expressed in a single sentence. For example: Elias is a person Elias is a man Elias is a male Elias is a parent of Fiona Fiona is a child of Elias Elias is a father of Fiona Fiona is a daughter of Elias Paul and Isa are parents of Lea and Elias &hellip; So, on top of a model there might be a collection of text generators. Output of those generators can be fed to a model: Supervised - question and answer &ldquo;How many sisters does Bryan have?&rdquo; - &ldquo;Two&rdquo; &ldquo;Who are Bryan&rsquo;s sisters?&rdquo; - &ldquo;Clara and Fiona&rdquo; Unsupervised - factual statements A similar approach can be applied to other models - customer/accounts, organization or architecture model, etc. For example, from the Internet Banking System we can generate something like &ldquo;Accounts Summary Controller uses Mainframe Banking System Facade to make API calls to the Mainframe Banking System over XML/HTTPS&rdquo;. &ldquo;make API calls&rdquo; may also be generated as &ldquo;connect&rdquo; or &ldquo;make requests&rdquo;. In a similar fashion a number of questions/answers can be generated."},"core/graph/index.html":{"path":"Core/Graph","action-uuid":"d9487ca2-3ca8-4e23-aa19-1e9f6bf77d20","title":"Graph","content":"TODO"},"core/index.html":{"action-uuid":"3599d63b-093a-4bd9-a097-cc3f13ba522f","title":"Core","content":"TODO"},"html/models/index.html":{"path":"HTML/Models","action-uuid":"47f492e3-0e30-408c-bbf7-07f3a6f82e7c","title":"Models","content":"TODO"},"practices/generic/index.html":{"path":"Practices/Analysis, Visualization &amp; Generation","action-uuid":"4f67cfd1-3494-4016-ad61-440d87e2e48b","title":"Analysis, Visualization &amp; Generation","content":"This practice explains how to use Nasdanika products (specifically models) and related products. The above diagram shows the core idea - load input data into a model, modify the model or create a new model from it, and save the models to native (raw) formats. Loading to a model as opposed to working with raw formats gives the following benefits: Unified API Generated model documentation with visualizations Different models may extend classes from core models and be treated similarly Model classes may be subclassed and mixed Cross-reference model elements URI handlers allows to load models from diverse sources On-demand loading of resources and features of model elements Conversion of models to graphs and making them executable with graph processors E.g. want to read/write Excel files - take a look at the Excel metamodel and then use Ecore API to work with the model. Now want to work with PDF? A different metamodel, the same model API. You have Java sources stored in GitLab and want model elements to reflect both Java and GitLab natures of your sources? Create a GitLabRepositoryCompilationUnit class which extends both Compilation Unit and Repository File. Customize Loader to create this class for repository files with java extension. Want to load a PDF file directly from GitLab without having to clone the entire repository? Use GitLabURIHandler! The below diagram illustrates the above concepts: Models can be visualized using: ECharts using the ECharts model, ECharts-Java or by directly generating JavaScript/JSON. Example. PlantUML using DiagramGenerator, the diagram module or by directly generating PlantUML text and calling Plant UML API&rsquo;s. Example. Holistic model of an organization One use case for the modeling approach outlined above is creation of a holistic model of an organization/corporation as exemplified by the below diagram1 In a corporation different elements of the model are typically stored in different systems and documents like Excel spreadsheets. The modeling approach allows to load those elements in a single resource set and cross-reference them. Elements which are not stored in structured formats can be captured by modeling them in diagrams and mapping those diagrams to models, see Beyond Diagrams. One important reason why a holistic model might be beneficial for an organization is the ability of using it for AI insights. For example, using RAG/Chat on top of the organization model. Such chat can be made context-aware, chatting with the Operations will return result relevant to operations. The above diagram is very simple, a large organization may have many layers, thousands of applications, millions of lines of code. A model for such an organization would take some time to build, but it can be built incrementally - department by department, application by application. The value of building such a model will grow exponentially as more and more elements are added due to the network effect. While the resulting model might be &ldquo;large&rdquo;, &hellip; define large. Experiments show that a model element in a model like the above takes ~ 500 bytes of RAM. As such, 1 GB of RAM would hold about 2 million model elements. Also, model resources are loaded on demand, so only the model elements needed by some task would be loaded to complete that task. With DynamicDelegate it is possible to have model elements loading their data from multiple sources on demand. The organization model can be built on top of existing &ldquo;generic&rdquo; models such as Java, Maven, GitLab, Azure, &hellip; Resources TOGAF Enterprise Metamodel Corporate structure ↩ Output Model Transformation Input Model Raw Input Raw Output Cell Excel Resource Paragraph PDF Resource Resource Set GitLab URI Handler MS Excel Workbook GitLab Excel Resource Factory PDF Resource Factory PDF File File system Corporation Marketing Finance Uses Operations HR Builds IT Execution environments Binary packages Source Code Application"}}
