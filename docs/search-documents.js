Common - common functionality such as the execution model, resource and persistence frameworks. Model - Contains Diagram, DiagramElement, Node, Connection, &hellip; classes Generators - Generators from the model to different formats including PlantUML and Drawio Drawio - Java API for reading and writing Drawio files including base classes for loading of EMF models from Drawio diagrams EMF - classes for working with Ecore models, e.g. classes for loading models from YAML files. Exec - Ecore models and adapters to execution model participants to build code generators and to load model content from different sources. Model - Ecore model containing flow control, content, and resource classes Generators - Adapters to execution participants Graph - Java API for working with directed graphs, such as diagrams. Includes mapping of graph elements to Java methods and fields to make graphs excutable. Also includes a base class for loading EMF models from graphs. Ncore - Ecore model containing common classes used/extended in other models. Resources - An abstraction layer for working with resources - units of content organized into directories, e.g. files or zip file entries. Persistence - A persistence framework focusing on loading data from key/value formats such as YAML and JSON. HTML - Java API&rsquo;s and models for generating HTML Bootstrap - Fluent Java API to generate Bootstrap 4 markup. Ecore - Classes to generate documentation of Ecore models as action models (see Models/Application below). EMF - Base classes for building generators of action models from Ecore model elements. HTML - Fluent Java API to generate HTML 5 markup. JsTree - Java API for generating jsTree JSON. Models - Ecore models to build HTML pages and applications. HTML - Ecore model representing HTML elements and generation adapters. Model - Ecore model of HTML elements Generators - Generator adapters for the HTML model Bootstrap - Ecore model representing Bootstrap 4 elements and generation adapters. Model - Ecore model of Bootstrap elements Generators - Generator adapters for the Bootstrap model Application - Ecore model representing a web site/application as a hierarchy of actions. Adapters to generate HTML sites (resource models) from action models. Model - Ecore model of application elements Drawio - Semantic mapping of Drawio diagrams to the application model. Allows to generate HTML sites from diagrams. Generators - Generator adapters for the application model Demos App Drawio - Demonstrations of generation of HTML sites from Drawio diagrams Actions - Demonstrates generation of a documentation site from a Drawio diagram using Amazon AWS deployment diagram as an example Flow - Demonstrates generation of a documentation site from a flow/process Drawio diagram Map - Demonstrates generation of a documentation site from a (mind) map Drawio diagram TOGAF - Models representing TOGAF concepts. ADM - flow model of TOGAF Architecture Development Method Nasdanika products are Java-based, hosted on GitHub Nasdanika organization and published to Maven Central: Core HTML Common Common classes including the Nasdanika Execution Framework Drawio Java API for reading and writing Drawio files including base classes for loading of EMF models from Drawio diagrams EMF EMF-related functionality - adapters, classes for building CLI's for executable models, persistence including loading of models from Excel files Flow A model of process flows - activities performed by participants using resources Graph Java API for working with directed graphs, such as diagrams. Includes mapping of graph elements to Java methods and fields to make graphs excutable. Also includes a base class for loading EMF models from graphs.
